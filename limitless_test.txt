- Unknown (4/30/25 9:47 AM): Yeah.

- Unknown (4/30/25 9:50 AM): So we don't have to join the the Friday morning huddle anymore.

- Unknown (4/30/25 9:50 AM): Right?

- Unknown (4/30/25 9:50 AM): No.

- Unknown (4/30/25 9:50 AM): They're no longer store ops.

- Unknown (4/30/25 9:50 AM): We left that life last week.

- Unknown (4/30/25 9:50 AM): No about that life.

- Unknown (4/30/25 9:50 AM): No longer about that life.

- Unknown (4/30/25 9:51 AM): Thinking novel novels, we have to ride a like, ride a well, his direct report is to ride a like, go to Spark, deliver something.

- Unknown (4/30/25 9:51 AM): Every Friday.

- Unknown (4/30/25 9:51 AM): Every month, I think, or something like that, which makes sense.

- Unknown (4/30/25 9:51 AM): Yeah.

- Unknown (4/30/25 9:51 AM): Wait.

- Unknown (4/30/25 9:51 AM): Do you pay any more than the store upgrades?

- Unknown (4/30/25 9:51 AM): No.

- Unknown (4/30/25 9:51 AM): We're not in store ups.

- Unknown (4/30/25 9:51 AM): And you're not super ups?

- Unknown (4/30/25 9:51 AM): But what did you do now?

- Unknown (4/30/25 9:51 AM): Knob's Knob's direct reports, and I and I think he's he pushes it down all the way.

- Unknown (4/30/25 9:51 AM): Like, everyone has to get in and deliver and Spark and deliver packages.

- Unknown (4/30/25 9:51 AM): Oh, okay.

- Unknown (4/30/25 9:51 AM): Ride along?

- Unknown (4/30/25 9:51 AM): No.

- Unknown (4/30/25 9:51 AM): No.

- Unknown (4/30/25 9:51 AM): I mean, No.

- Unknown (4/30/25 9:51 AM): No.

- Unknown (4/30/25 9:51 AM): Not a ride along, but Actually Actually, go do it.

- Unknown (4/30/25 9:51 AM): Yeah.

- Unknown (4/30/25 9:51 AM): We can we move up.

- Unknown (4/30/25 9:51 AM): Well, I think he probably would tell us to properly ride along.

- Unknown (4/30/25 9:51 AM): I wanna do it in the Tesla.

- Unknown (4/30/25 9:52 AM): That delivering in a Tesla isn't bad if you like, if you don't mind your tires probably getting punctured because there's a lot of not developed places here.

- Unknown (4/30/25 9:52 AM): And there's some places where I honestly felt like I was might might get shot by somebody.

- Unknown (4/30/25 9:52 AM): Yeah.

- Unknown (4/30/25 9:52 AM): Country, like, shot.

- Unknown (4/30/25 9:52 AM): Not like shot like gangsters.

- Unknown (4/30/25 10:23 AM): check with uh legal here again.

- Unknown (4/30/25 10:23 AM): All right, Josh.

- Unknown (4/30/25 10:23 AM): We're asking to go vendor. You want to check with legal today? Just run it through them about the device requirement.

- Unknown (4/30/25 10:23 AM): I don't know in the past when we were drafting the contracts, they asked us a couple of times that are we providing them any device or not providing them any device or

- Unknown (4/30/25 10:24 AM): We're not providing them a device.

- Unknown (4/30/25 10:24 AM): Yeah, but we are requiring the vendor to put a device.

- Unknown (4/30/25 10:24 AM): Device to watch and report.

- Unknown (4/30/25 10:24 AM): No, in a phone in a car.

- Unknown (4/30/25 10:24 AM): Yes, yes, I mean

- Unknown (4/30/25 10:24 AM): currently the phone uh is used by the driver. They bring their own phone, but their phone has been buggy and they create a lot of issues. When they call Spark, they're calling from a different number and all that stuff. To standardize that, we're requiring the contractor or subcontractor to keep keep

- Unknown (4/30/25 10:24 AM): So worth is differently.

- Unknown (4/30/25 10:24 AM): We require a phone number to be consistent.

- Unknown (4/30/25 10:24 AM): Consistent and uh in there.

- Unknown (4/30/25 10:24 AM): That means that they need to have a device and like I would I wouldn't require I would require them to have a phone number that's going to be used all the all the time.

- Unknown (4/30/25 10:24 AM): Like that's will be my requirement is that you have a single phone number that's tied to that van because no van driver is driving seven days a week.

- Unknown (4/30/25 10:24 AM): Yeah.

- Unknown (4/30/25 10:24 AM): If it's to the broker and we tell the broker we need to have a dedicated number, legal doesn't need to be involved because it's broker and it's part of our expectations as a service partner.

- Unknown (4/30/25 10:25 AM): Now if the broker is telling the driver buy a phone and then what should they want because it's going to go straight through the broker. So the broker should have a dedicated phone.

- Unknown (4/30/25 10:25 AM): Well, makes it hard because they switch drivers daily.

- Unknown (4/30/25 10:25 AM): Well, that's why the phone should be tied to the van.

- Unknown (4/30/25 10:25 AM): But the vans are different vans based off of who who own who the subcontractor is.

- Unknown (4/30/25 10:25 AM): So like when they broker up the vans, it's not one van that they broker out. It's this is Hakeem's van, this is Nitten's van that they're servicing for the day or using.

- Unknown (4/30/25 10:25 AM): So it's not we're not brokering out the van, we're brokering out the driver and the drivers typically have their own vans that they use.

- Unknown (4/30/25 10:25 AM): Right. So you're talking about the subcontractor, right?

- Unknown (4/30/25 10:26 AM): Yeah.

- Unknown (4/30/25 10:26 AM): So the subcontractor just needs to have a stable phone in their van.

- Unknown (4/30/25 10:26 AM): But what what are we talking about? The same phone number then for

- Unknown (4/30/25 10:26 AM): So for that route, they need to have the same phone number. And if they want to update the phone number, that's fine, but what we're asking for is a consistent device for the entire day. Right now what we're seeing is them using multiple devices, so they're logging out of one device and then logging into another device, which is causing us issues on Spark because it's not how Spark was built.

- Unknown (4/30/25 10:26 AM): So are we fine with the subcontractors using their own phone as long as they use one phone daily, switching out throughout the day?

- Unknown (4/30/25 10:26 AM): Yeah.

- Unknown (4/30/25 10:26 AM): Correct.

- Unknown (4/30/25 10:26 AM): Yeah, that's fine.

- Unknown (4/30/25 10:26 AM): And then they need to and if they want to change the phone number, they need to call us and I mean not call us, email, well send teams, whatever, and just change the number.

- Unknown (4/30/25 10:26 AM): Because you have to have the number and what's the name?

- Unknown (4/30/25 10:26 AM): to leave it in legal then because we wouldn't if it were us telling the the contractor

- Unknown (4/30/25 10:26 AM): Uh-huh.

- Unknown (4/30/25 10:27 AM): to the broker. We're we're telling them one cell phone and have it in the van, but the subcontract but the contractor doesn't own the van. The vans are owned by the subcontractors.

- Unknown (4/30/25 10:27 AM): Right, but we're just we're telling the broker what the requirement is. And this protects us from legal because legal also if they're using if the driver is using their own um

- Unknown (4/30/25 10:30 AM): their own device with the issue comes down to is that now we are tracking their device and then we're not we're not entering a contract with the driver as far as their information privacy, privacy information. So we may end up

- Unknown (4/30/25 10:30 AM): But you see where the issue is that if every van is owned by the subcontractor, how are they going to get the same phone every single day? If you work Monday and Tuesday in your van, and then he works Wednesday and Thursday in his van, how much you just going to

- Unknown (4/30/25 10:30 AM): phone in the and because it's the same subcontractor. So why wouldn't you just leave the phone in the van? I'm not understanding.

- Unknown (4/30/25 10:31 AM): So, whenever a subcontractor is subcontracted out, they come with their own van. Right. vehicle van.

- Unknown (4/30/25 10:31 AM): Right.

- Unknown (4/30/25 10:31 AM): So, if you are Hakeem and you bought your own van and you own your own van that you use to work. Right. And he did the same thing, how are you guys going to transfer the phone to each other? You're not in the same like the vans are individually owned by you two. And then you work for the contractor.

- Unknown (4/30/25 10:31 AM): Right.

- Unknown (4/30/25 10:31 AM): In terms of Uber, right? Like people drive for Uber, but the contractor is Uber. They each own their own cars. So how are we going to tell them we need all of the people servicing this account to only have one phone and one phone number.

- Unknown (4/30/25 10:31 AM): How are they doing it today?

- Unknown (4/30/25 10:31 AM): They don't.

- Unknown (4/30/25 10:31 AM): They do? You have to, or you can't contact the customer.

- Unknown (4/30/25 10:31 AM): I get so

- Unknown (4/30/25 10:32 AM): Yeah, dude, exactly. Yeah, I'm they seem to seem but I I think what you're saying is that a lot of our independent drivers or contractors have subcontracted to drivers that have their own vans. So bringing different vans.

- Unknown (4/30/25 10:32 AM): That's that's fine. And what we're saying is is either vendor or subcontractor, figure out a way to operationally transfer the phones when you're when you when you change shifts.

- Unknown (4/30/25 10:32 AM): point of we'll have to talk to the vendors, but I think FTC might have a issue with that because

- Unknown (4/30/25 10:32 AM): FTC is W2.

- Unknown (4/30/25 10:32 AM): Yeah, yeah, they're W2, but um they work on the franchise model.

- Unknown (4/30/25 10:32 AM): Uh-huh.

- Unknown (4/30/25 10:32 AM): So they like everyone is an independent

- Unknown (4/30/25 10:32 AM): Everyone's an independent contractor. I guess I don't understand why FTC couldn't just buy a phone and just say this phone goes in the van.

- Unknown (4/30/25 10:32 AM): because the vans are changing.

- Unknown (4/30/25 10:32 AM): Then change the I mean then pass off the phone. Uh they're they're meeting up to do a stand up, apparently.

- Unknown (4/30/25 10:32 AM): Yeah, but the driver, so the driver performs all deliveries for the day, he's got the phone. He goes home, end of day. Next driver comes in on Tuesday, how are they getting the phone?

- Unknown (4/30/25 10:33 AM): That's operationally they need to figure that out. I don't even know why we're talking about it. That that's how they should figure out how do you hand off the phone. If we had to if we all had to share a phone for this for this job,

- Unknown (4/30/25 10:33 AM): we would figure out a way. Hey, I'm going to leave the phone here on Monday and then you're going to then you'll pick up the phone on Tuesday when you're coming to work.

- Unknown (4/30/25 10:33 AM): just say that we need to have two or three numbers at max.

- Unknown (4/30/25 10:33 AM): Technically you can't.

- Unknown (4/30/25 10:33 AM): Unless I mean, I mean technically, so technically you can, then that means that and and and the SIM will be changing the phone numbers out every day.

- Unknown (4/30/25 10:33 AM): That when we have the new app that changes that can do it themselves. Well, all the drivers would be uploaded into things. So it wouldn't matter. But

- Unknown (4/30/25 10:33 AM): Yeah, I think we need to involve legal then because it's going to be requiring the broker to say goodbye your phone and then create a process with the drivers on how to transfer the phone amongst each other.

- Unknown (4/30/25 10:34 AM): I don't think I don't think we need to be involved. I think we clearly set out the requirements.

- Unknown (4/30/25 10:34 AM): if we require that?

- Unknown (4/30/25 10:34 AM): Well, the so

- Unknown (4/30/25 10:34 AM): have to input it on the contract.

- Unknown (4/30/25 10:34 AM): So the thing is is right now, we do require that. Like right now, the reason the the reason why some people probably have higher returns than other people is because they can't contact the customer. Yeah. This is this has been a requirement since we started the program and I've I've communicated that you need to have the same phone number. This isn't new. Now, people if they disregarded it that they disregarded it, but part of the business is being able to have the phone number match the the thing.

- Unknown (4/30/25 10:34 AM): And in terms of operation, right? Like we'll take it back to the vendors. Yeah. And we'll see what their feedback is and how they can implement it and we can figure that out.

- Unknown (4/30/25 10:34 AM): I think to Josh's point, if we need to if you're including a language like that.

- Unknown (4/30/25 10:34 AM): But we're not input I don't think we need to input the language. I think the language is clear. We need

- Unknown (4/30/25 10:35 AM): language is no language. Yeah. contract right now. It says each carrier must have one phone that is used for the account.

- Unknown (4/30/25 10:35 AM): You don't have that language.

- Unknown (4/30/25 10:35 AM): I I don't think we need to use to use the so from from the text standpoint,

- Unknown (4/30/25 10:35 AM): I think we got to go.

- Unknown (4/30/25 10:35 AM): Oh. from from the text standpoint, you need to uh

- Unknown (4/30/25 10:35 AM): So it legal is going to be involved regardless because because of uh the privacy the privacy conversation. So legal is going to be involved regardless. This is the way we mitigate that risk. I don't think legal is going to have an issue with with that fact.

- Unknown (4/30/25 10:35 AM): I would just see that you run it through them whenever you're comfortable like today or

- Unknown (4/30/25 10:35 AM): Well, we're I mean, we're running through the private and these are two different legals that we're talking about. I don't think our legal is going to care one way or the other. If you want to add it to the what's the name of digital citizenship, if we don't mitigate the risk, then we're going to we're going to have a bigger problem because then we're going to

- Unknown (4/30/25 10:36 AM): talking about all this because of that because of that woman, that lawyer that reached out and asked us questions about

- Unknown (4/30/25 10:36 AM): She set up a me yeah, we set up a meeting with her. Uh that's there, but um it's it's it's it's ERPA it's ERPA thing because before

- Unknown (4/30/25 10:36 AM): We were uh it's not we were under the assumption, it was a fact that every driver that worked with us had their own phone had the phone number that matches the thing. So I could I can definitively say that we don't have any of the driver's information.

- Unknown (4/30/25 10:36 AM): Now, if drivers are using their own phone, we definitely have their information and we aren't signing into a contract with that driver about what we're using their data for.

- Unknown (4/30/25 10:36 AM): Is there a way for us to just create a login for each vendor and that vendor can share the login with the

- Unknown (4/30/25 10:36 AM): No, that already happens and that's fine.

- Unknown (4/30/25 10:36 AM): So what's the point of a phone number then?

- Unknown (4/30/25 10:37 AM): Well, you can't contact the customer without the phone number.

- Unknown (4/30/25 10:37 AM): So you can't contact them through the app where

- Unknown (4/30/25 10:37 AM): No, yeah, because in order to in order to spoof the number, you need to have a number to call the customer or otherwise it says it's blocked because you can't spoof the number because your number doesn't match that and they don't want the driver to just be able to call a customer afterwards. Then you get a customer uh

- Unknown (4/30/25 10:37 AM): Yo, basically I'll figure it out, but I think legally Yeah to go ahead.

- Unknown (4/30/25 10:37 AM): Yeah. I mean, yeah, run it run it by legal. I just don't I don't think it's necessary because technically you're just saying that you need to have a phone, but I mean, and we're not involved.

- Unknown (4/30/25 10:37 AM): Yeah.

- Unknown (4/30/25 10:37 AM): So, but I don't know, they might think differently.

- Unknown (4/30/25 10:39 AM): and I'm not trying to put all out.

- Unknown (4/30/25 10:39 AM): I have

- Unknown (4/30/25 10:40 AM): I honestly don't.

- Unknown (4/30/25 10:42 AM): you know.

- Unknown (4/30/25 10:45 AM): This is just for 11:33.

- Unknown (4/30/25 10:45 AM): Yeah.

- Unknown (4/30/25 10:45 AM): Yeah.

- Unknown (4/30/25 10:45 AM): I'm not

- Unknown (4/30/25 11:06 AM): Alright.

- Unknown (4/30/25 11:06 AM): Casey, Joe from the FC Post Center side.

- Unknown (4/30/25 11:06 AM): I know next week, we've got Detroit launching from Indy Free, and then the rest are from the Mandolin side.

- Unknown (4/30/25 11:06 AM): So big big chunk of stores there.

- Unknown (4/30/25 11:06 AM): From now?

- Unknown (4/30/25 11:06 AM): Yeah.

- Unknown (4/30/25 11:06 AM): No.

- Unknown (4/30/25 11:06 AM): Everything's smooth on the FC side.

- Unknown (4/30/25 11:06 AM): Same here.

- Unknown (4/30/25 11:06 AM): We're we're good to go.

- Unknown (4/30/25 11:07 AM): And we've got we've had our our transportation managers that are on-site at your previous standing office going out and doing this tour business as well, getting geared up.

- Unknown (4/30/25 11:07 AM): how they curl.

- Unknown (4/30/25 11:08 AM): it's a big problem. We're not being Brian. three of us.

- Unknown (4/30/25 11:08 AM): several months.

- Unknown (4/30/25 11:08 AM): Yeah, we got a meeting later on with with legal to see what stores we can help for June and July. We have a tentative list from Mark, so more to come by end of day on that.

- Unknown (4/30/25 11:09 AM): I think that's fair. I think it's it's uh

- Unknown (4/30/25 11:10 AM): Well, I would I would view it slightly different where I don't think I don't think so.

- Unknown (4/30/25 11:10 AM): I was cool really what I like to do. Yeah, I'm good with process too. simple. I can just understand. I was good with all of that. So just provide a little bit of for

- Unknown (4/30/25 11:10 AM): and I'm coming at one. I have our head of my contact.

- Unknown (4/30/25 11:11 AM): what kind of data you might not be able to do in my life says what what would if you ever have to reach out. Like let's say we had this process. Let's say we of course in several weeks.

- Unknown (4/30/25 11:11 AM): interviews with people at store level, people at home office and I have a pretty good understanding of what that what the escalation process looks like at a high level.

- Unknown (4/30/25 11:11 AM): in those context, those types of process, what data and or inputs would be needed to basically quantify what's happening. that's think together.

- Unknown (4/30/25 11:14 AM): I got to ask that before I get it now. I'm asking what you just laid out is kind of what you would need to for that. Um so

- Unknown (4/30/25 11:14 AM): what's that process to get with

- Unknown (4/30/25 11:15 AM): Oh, perfect.  Oh, I'll speak about, you know, had a breaker talking about this.  I think this is one of those contexts that if there was a better way to do this, if it would have already been done. It's not like the teams probably working on it, are probably aware of this and probably just working.

- Unknown (4/30/25 11:15 AM): like probably a little bit of how that's being operated regularly, probably.

- Unknown (4/30/25 11:16 AM): was great data, they were able to cover they are able to cover why the process sucks.

- Unknown (4/30/25 11:16 AM): So, I think that I think that's the right comment to travel with. I think what first number one's being asked to do is to

- Unknown (4/30/25 11:16 AM): really to provide this structure is understand and have this thing issue of an escalation.

- Unknown (4/30/25 11:16 AM): What are the different buckets within that? What, you know, what's what's happening within those steps? Quantify it and data and then based off that information, move forward with the process.

- Unknown (4/30/25 11:16 AM): obviously way over simplistic because that goes into influx of data or what I'm currently giving you guys either about things that don't exist, which is very hard to find or

- Unknown (4/30/25 11:17 AM): that I've got enough to be able to tell the story.

- Unknown (4/30/25 11:17 AM): I think what I think the point of this and we have another one this everything, right? is really

- Unknown (4/30/25 11:17 AM): you know, today. But if you had a minute of time and you could say, what would you have to have this and just to help find that and have it break down would provide additional clarity to

- Unknown (4/30/25 11:17 AM): whatever team we are and say, we just want to make this a little bit better.

- Unknown (4/30/25 11:20 AM): right?

- Unknown (4/30/25 11:20 AM): together and everything's asked, I think I would like to understand. Yeah. All the things you would want to have that clarity.

- Unknown (4/30/25 11:21 AM): right? I just want to understand what specifically

- Unknown (4/30/25 11:21 AM): level of clarity. questions to answer. Yeah, yeah, I understand. Yeah. But are you going to add?

- Unknown (4/30/25 11:21 AM): Oh, yeah, so this right now. How face?

- Unknown (4/30/25 11:21 AM): Yeah, yeah.

- Unknown (4/30/25 11:22 AM): I was able to intuitively understand what actually was missing from the processes. I was like, currently what data those processes is where it comes from. Uh, this is what

- Unknown (4/30/25 11:22 AM): Affordable.

- Unknown (4/30/25 11:22 AM): one other one is affordable thing.

- Unknown (4/30/25 11:22 AM): That's up.

- Unknown (4/30/25 11:22 AM): affordable.

- Unknown (4/30/25 11:22 AM): There's such a good deal in there.

- Unknown (4/30/25 11:23 AM): But I I sat there and I did this.

- Unknown (4/30/25 11:23 AM): So I tried to make people feel really now.

- Unknown (4/30/25 11:23 AM): I'm a little bit more position to draft this out.

- Unknown (4/30/25 11:24 AM): what you're saying makes sense. I understand it's step one is obviously to do the fucking that's it.

- Unknown (4/30/25 11:24 AM): it's just, you know, I don't know what I don't know.

- Unknown (4/30/25 11:24 AM): what uh what you need from a from a data standpoint. So it's really really kind of.

- Unknown (4/30/25 11:24 AM): back so let me start getting that discovery which then you'll be required to understand this is what we need to see.

- Unknown (4/30/25 11:24 AM): that's what you're going to be without jobs or apps, I don't know, you know, it's not.

- Unknown (4/30/25 11:25 AM): you want to take this nice.

- Unknown (4/30/25 11:25 AM): I she's fine.

- Unknown (4/30/25 11:25 AM): what data we need.

- Unknown (4/30/25 11:25 AM): Saturday or Sunday.

- Unknown (4/30/25 11:25 AM): orders.

- Unknown (4/30/25 11:26 AM): I think we got.

- Unknown (4/30/25 11:26 AM): All right, no, I think that's fair. I think we got.

- Unknown (4/30/25 11:26 AM): this kind of problem. you guys are like second feeling about right.

- Unknown (4/30/25 11:26 AM): You know, and so that's that I think a lot of this and that's that's really frustrating, right? Whatever. But I think a lot of this it's really really.

- Unknown (4/30/25 11:27 AM): hey, oh, we have this issue with with and and we have this bad process. first time they're doing they have they have the last day. I think there's a lot of for some very.

- Unknown (4/30/25 11:27 AM): policy things a lot of.

- Unknown (4/30/25 11:27 AM): not that's not solvable but it's going to take a lot of time. So just just.

- Unknown (4/30/25 11:27 AM): we got all this out of the door for a couple of months.

- Unknown (4/30/25 11:28 AM): Oh well yeah, they're they're permanent kind of like.

- Unknown (4/30/25 11:28 AM): Yeah, sounds good again. I don't think anything corporate anything is really.

- Unknown (4/30/25 11:28 AM): understanding.

- Unknown (4/30/25 11:29 AM): lot of times the neighborhood still have it.

- Unknown (4/30/25 11:29 AM): No, they're just like, why are we being brought in?

- Unknown (4/30/25 11:29 AM): doesn't make sense.

- Unknown (4/30/25 11:29 AM): You don't have it defined.

- Unknown (4/30/25 11:29 AM): No, they're they're just acting like they're not.

- Unknown (4/30/25 11:29 AM): a question of.

- Unknown (4/30/25 11:29 AM): you're in this.

- Unknown (4/30/25 11:30 AM): That's a great question.

- Unknown (4/30/25 11:32 AM): Hey.

- Unknown (4/30/25 11:32 AM): Good afternoon, everyone.

- Unknown (4/30/25 11:32 AM): Give it a couple of more minutes for see Scott to join.

- Unknown (4/30/25 11:32 AM): But this meeting here is gonna be the same meeting.

- Unknown (4/30/25 11:33 AM): Oh, there you are.

- Unknown (4/30/25 11:33 AM): Cool.

- Unknown (4/30/25 11:33 AM): So long story short, everyone, this meeting is essentially gonna be the same meeting that has been being led by Ashwin previously, but we've had a couple of board changes and shifts that occurred last week.

- Unknown (4/30/25 11:33 AM): To.

- Unknown (4/30/25 11:34 AM): Work closely together to do some pretty cool stuff together for the last office.

- Unknown (4/30/25 11:34 AM): So with that said, we're going to kick things off and start the agenda.

- Unknown (4/30/25 11:34 AM): First topic that we have, Mario, if you wanna quickly take five minutes to kind of review.

- Unknown (4/30/25 11:34 AM): But, essentially, we have some language that we created for the brokers that will essentially allow us to provide not provide, but we train the brokers on how to use our Spark app, and then the expectation would be that the brokers would then train the drivers.

- Unknown (4/30/25 11:35 AM): Mario, No.

- Unknown (4/30/25 11:39 AM): It doesn't.

- Unknown (4/30/25 11:39 AM): It it doesn't.

- Unknown (4/30/25 11:39 AM): No.

- Unknown (4/30/25 11:39 AM): Persona's not turned on for dedicated delivery.

- Unknown (4/30/25 11:39 AM): No.

- Unknown (4/30/25 11:42 AM): Yeah.

- Unknown (4/30/25 11:42 AM): Oh.

- Unknown (4/30/25 11:46 AM): Just basically think about all the best you know.

- Unknown (4/30/25 11:47 AM): Hey, uh, thank you, Mario. Uh, I'm going to share my screen and process.

- Unknown (4/30/25 11:47 AM): And that's now it's all that process. Please stay eyes.

- Unknown (4/30/25 11:47 AM): So first I just want to add some kind of context. So as as the group knows, we were initially planned to launch 600 plus vans. That's been reduced to 200 primarily due to uh app concerns and in those cases where something risk entering certain markets.

- Unknown (4/30/25 11:47 AM): Um, however, our van business is in itself beginning to be put in a risky situation because the business is moving on with or without us. Um, to add additional context, we have about 185 stores that van for van for planned to launch it from those stores. There are now solutions that are being time limited and trial to essentially skip vans and just use comments.

- Unknown (4/30/25 11:48 AM): More volume for the part. So I've drafted a lot of contracts in my time. I drafted the entire contract with Samsung. Um, and it's it's very standard. Entering risky states is pretty standard and most companies don't prevent themselves from providing a customer service because of risk requirements. They typically uh create, you know, very detailed scope of works and very detailed broker disclaimers that put it plainly and simply that, you know, making it as difficult as possible for any litigation to occur.

- Unknown (4/30/25 11:48 AM): So I just want to quickly run through something that I've drafted and get feedback and thoughts because these are 12 locations that the IP team would like power van support with. However, from these locations, uh, there is concern from a people perspective with going into New Jersey and Massachusetts.

- Unknown (4/30/25 11:49 AM): So sort of this is where the entire thought process behind this came from is what if instead of taking ourselves out of states that are risky, we just create a robust risk mitigation contract and scope of work instead.

- Unknown (4/30/25 11:49 AM): So, first section here is just a general services disclaimer, you know, what the broker is going to be doing for Walmart for performing delivery. customer professional customer direction. Here's really where we start to get into how we keep ourselves from getting sued when we go really deep like Massachusetts and robust detailed language that states independent contractor is working for the broker independently. It's not a partnership between the driver or the independent contractor and platform or Walmart and the broker.

- Unknown (4/30/25 11:50 AM): Uh, clear language that states that the drivers are engaged by the broker, employees of the broker or contractors of the broker and not the employees for Walmart. And then we got some specific state laws primarily in states that we've seen like California, Massachusetts, New Jersey, kind of noise in the north where for the most part, these are typically the labor laws that most drivers have used to go and report losses against Amazon.

- Unknown (4/30/25 11:50 AM): Next is the control and business section and just more language stating that the broker or contractor controls all direction and methods of driver performance. Uh, and that Walmart has no ability to be involved disciplining or understanding work schedules or anything related to the drivers. It's solely Walmart being limited to monitoring the service outcomes, right?

- Unknown (4/30/25 11:51 AM): I think they have it at a high level, but I'm trying to add an additional layer of it's uh help mitigate this uh focus in those like California, New Jersey and what not.

- Unknown (4/30/25 11:51 AM): Which Yep, then.

- Unknown (4/30/25 11:52 AM): So with that said as well, I think completely understood that if the drivers that are being contracted by the broker sign a waiver for some sort of acknowledgement that says that, you know, they will not perform any claims against Walmart under any cause related to, you know, co-employment, whatever the case may be, whatever the employment. There are ways for us to be able to mitigate and reduce that risk exposure regardless of based off of what we ask our brokers to onboard these drivers based off of specific terms.

- Unknown (4/30/25 11:53 AM): You know, things that I've done in my past with Samsung, I created a contract years ago and they've not been sued. And that's been in California, New Jersey, Massachusetts, Colorado, all of the risk states. So what I'm essentially trying to do here Scott is figure out a way if understanding that the app is not going to be something that's going to come to life until probably about Q1 Q2.

- Unknown (4/30/25 11:53 AM): Why wouldn't it be a wise idea for us to just create a detailed robust risk adverse contract that covers as much as we possibly can that prevents us from going down that route of litigation. Why are we allowing ourselves to be risk adverse markets when ultimately we're going to enter these markets regardless. The app is only one component, the app is only a route route aspect.

- Unknown (4/30/25 11:54 AM): Um, but ultimately if we have some language in a contract that states they cannot sue us, they cannot make any claims against us.

- Unknown (4/30/25 11:54 AM): Oh, I didn't know that.

- Unknown (4/30/25 11:54 AM): It's like the reverse sauna.

- Unknown (4/30/25 11:54 AM): I have that. I don't think that exists.

- Unknown (4/30/25 11:55 AM): Yeah.

- Unknown (4/30/25 11:55 AM): And I would the only point that I would bring up is there's a difference between Amazon's DSPs and us.

- Unknown (4/30/25 11:55 AM): So Amazon's DSPs, as you know, they are literally owners, quote, unquote, but they typically can only service Amazon's accounts.

- Unknown (4/30/25 11:56 AM): The what makes us slightly different is we're not going to a DSP.

- Unknown (4/30/25 11:56 AM): We are going through a broker, and that broker then contracts a DSP.

- Unknown (4/30/25 11:56 AM): So when we do enter California, nothing will have changed about the program beyond the fact that a driver can now skip a route essentially.

- Unknown (4/30/25 11:56 AM): It's basically, like let's think about the downshares that will grow there because most people will repair.

- Unknown (4/30/25 11:56 AM): So Spark is not Walmart?

- Unknown (4/30/25 11:57 AM): It's not Walmart.

- Unknown (4/30/25 11:57 AM): Yeah.

- Unknown (4/30/25 11:57 AM): That's not Walmart brand.

- Unknown (4/30/25 11:57 AM): Like a pool party.

- Unknown (4/30/25 11:57 AM): Yeah.

- Unknown (4/30/25 11:57 AM): And the primary purpose is not.

- Unknown (4/30/25 11:57 AM): Blazer gonna be branded or not?

- Unknown (4/30/25 11:58 AM): Say what?

- Unknown (4/30/25 11:58 AM): Is Blazer gonna be branded by Walmart or not?

- Unknown (4/30/25 11:58 AM): No.

- Unknown (4/30/25 11:58 AM): And know that a lot of this is done externally in terms of the discovery and the research.

- Unknown (4/30/25 11:59 AM): Do we happen to know specifically state by state what is risky about each state because, you know okay.

- Unknown (4/30/25 11:59 AM): Would you be able to share that with us just because I think I'd be able to go back to the business leadership and figure out, like, based off of what we're seeing here in partnership?

- Unknown (4/30/25 12:01 PM): Yeah.

- Unknown (4/30/25 12:01 PM): Yeah. And those are all very call outs and the kind of intention is not to bypass or you know.

- Unknown (4/30/25 12:01 PM): Got you. So primary concern really is that the routing, apparent routing situation, if we wait for us to mitigate that sooner than the van app, would it then be fair to say that we would have removed the majority of our concerns.

- Unknown (4/30/25 12:02 PM): Got you. Cool.

- Unknown (4/30/25 12:02 PM): Oh yeah, I really I actually wanted to. Um but they were like down the cliff and then back up and I just.

- Unknown (4/30/25 12:02 PM): So it's all on the fire and safe car. You just kind of have to kind of like that. Yeah.

- Unknown (4/30/25 12:03 PM): These are all good call outs. Scott, appreciate the time and context. Um ultimately what I mean, you know what we're trying to do here is just contract our way out and figure out a way we can just make ourselves so fine tuned and locked that we reduce the ability to even be sued until we have the app. Um what we're also facing is a prioritization issue where the app continues to be deprioritized because uh we don't have the ability to service the country nationally. So it's sort of a chicken versus the egg situation, right? We're trying to get vans live, but we can't get vans live because we don't have the app, but we can't get the app to get prioritized because vans aren't servicing anywhere. So what I would be essentially coming out of this was if we can partner with legal to the 200 van cap that we have totally aligned with that, but if there would be any willingness to allow flexibility for us to enter a couple of risky states with one or two vans even.

- Unknown (4/30/25 12:04 PM): And I had a quick question on the comment I made before about apparent routing. Are we saying that if that if the driver had the ability to go off the route that we would be more okay with that? Like and I'm talking the difference between the vendor and the driver, right? So the vendor, like that capability what you're what you're talking about is is going to take dev work regardless. But if we're talking about more like the driver has the ability to go off the route, is that helpful? Because I can definitely make it so that the driver can skip whatever route that we're doing and continue to go in whatever order that he wants to, but a route is provided.

- Unknown (4/30/25 12:05 PM): So, I mean, is that something that's helpful to make it less risk averse? I mean, it's not from a business standpoint, it's not smart, but from a legal uh standpoint if it works to make it less risk averse and then I can work. You know, obviously, if they go longer then that's between the company and the driver. Is that something that we could work with?

- Unknown (4/30/25 12:05 PM): And that's what I'm talking about. From a driver perspective, from a driver perspective though, they wouldn't have to go on the route.

- Unknown (4/30/25 12:05 PM): It it would it would just be that that's the best route that's available, but if you have better ideas then you can go a different route.

- Unknown (4/30/25 12:06 PM): I mean, from this you have the you have the address and the and the next address, the next 24 or 32 deliveries. So they could go another route. It's just like, you know, if you have a GPS, you could you I could go A to B, but I can decide to go A to C and then go back to B. If it allows me. Now, if it doesn't allow me to do that, that's a different thing, but if it if it allows me to do that, you know, then I I guess what would I mean, it's a recommendation if you can skip it is is what my statement would be.

- Unknown (4/30/25 12:06 PM): Cuz it's not a recommendation if you can't skip it. Then you're then I'm forcing you to take that route. But I'm just giving you the best route.

- Unknown (4/30/25 12:07 PM): Yeah, no, I'm definitely not uh trying trying to delay that. That's that's my whole purpose. But at the at the same time, I'm just trying to see if if that if that helps because believe it or not, contrary to to um what we would think, the drivers do ignore their routing and call to get packages uh get packages to move to different routes. So they are creating their own routes when they see it and that happens across all companies, right? So Amazon, they skip they skip it because they're in the field. They actually know, you know, how to deliver these packages versus um what the algorithm algorithm is saying and uh but I would uh if if it's not helpful, then it's something I won't explore. I was just wondering if that was a helpful solution for what we're talking about.

- Unknown (4/30/25 12:08 PM): I think we can continue to explore it. I'm keen because um ultimately the concern is us providing the route to the driver, but we've all done driver ride behinds and have seen where they skip the next route and they go across the street instead because they perform these routes every day and they know that it makes more sense to skip the next one, go to the third and then go back to the second one just because of you know right and left turns. So let's continue to explore this, but I have a final question because I know we're pretty off time. So thank you for staying on everyone is with the 200 van cap in mind and us respecting the 200 van cap decision, if we were to would if what would be your thoughts on us at least trialing one or two vans in risky markets?

- Unknown (4/30/25 12:09 PM): So that way we can continue to support the business in that case for vans so that way the van app can get reprioritized because right now we've got 42 vans and it's hard for us to get engineering resources to get aligned to delivering the app date because the business is going into the direction of Spark instead. So at this rate we won't have a van app for two or two and a half years, but if we were to be able to go into Massachusetts, for example, one or two vans and get the business excited and show that we need to have vans in these quote unquote risk markets, so we need to prioritize the app sooner. So would it be fine or fair for us to at least trial one or two vans in these markets?

- Unknown (4/30/25 12:10 PM): I like the person.

- Unknown (4/30/25 12:10 PM): I've never seen the wire.

- Unknown (4/30/25 12:13 PM): So ultimately, we can do whatever we want as long as we convince them that

- Unknown (4/30/25 12:13 PM): Well, so you keep saying it's a business decision, but it's always a business decision.

- Unknown (4/30/25 12:13 PM): So the issue was before, and I'm not sure that this is going to change because Kieran who wasn't comfortable, which is the same.

- Unknown (4/30/25 12:13 PM): Which is the same. But what I would say is, is that we do have another lever to pull. Like if we want to, if we want to expand and I hate it, but if we want to expand, actually I don't hate it, because then it makes my business case easier.

- Unknown (4/30/25 12:14 PM): I think we just push on the fucking Nash deal.

- Unknown (4/30/25 12:14 PM): Like my concern is beyond expanding, it's more so getting into these risky states because even though we

- Unknown (4/30/25 12:14 PM): Well no, we can't though.

- Unknown (4/30/25 12:14 PM): With Nash, we there's literally no no routing.

- Unknown (4/30/25 12:14 PM): The my biggest concern is, I mean, you know my concern. So there's there's no there's no question on that. Like the the business the business is what it is. It's going to cost a lot more. Our CPD is going to look terrible. But then I think all we can say, all we all we can continue saying is from there is if you want the CPD to go down, we need to prioritize this app.

- Unknown (4/30/25 12:14 PM): This guy is just risk adverse and that's his issue. He's not a business operator, he's never been involved.

- Unknown (4/30/25 12:14 PM): Well, he he doesn't even understand the routing because because that apparent routing that that uh that makes sense.

- Unknown (4/30/25 12:14 PM): So the primary thing, parent routing, contractually, if we now include another line that says routing can be dictated by the driver.

- Unknown (4/30/25 12:15 PM): It says that.

- Unknown (4/30/25 12:15 PM): He just confirmed that it says that.

- Unknown (4/30/25 12:15 PM): I don't even remember from top of my head, but so he thinks it does, but it doesn't. And if we say look, current contract does not have anything involving routing and driver expectations for routing. However, the new contract, the whole scope of work that I showed that he didn't like because it's pretty it's pretty nice.

- Unknown (4/30/25 12:15 PM): Um because I did that exact same thing at Samsung except I had to do it manually because there wasn't check.

- Unknown (4/30/25 12:15 PM): In a court of law, if someone has waved their just like when you receive a severance, there are employment laws that protect you against it, but if you wave your right for the severance and to retaliate to get the severance.

- Unknown (4/30/25 12:15 PM): Can you be by a class action lawsuit then?

- Unknown (4/30/25 12:16 PM): Yeah, you can.

- Unknown (4/30/25 12:16 PM): You can, right? That that's what the drivers do usually.

- Unknown (4/30/25 12:16 PM): We we got double layer.

- Unknown (4/30/25 12:16 PM): I I do have a I do have a question on Nash. What if we offer Nash but design our contract in a way that nobody takes Nash?

- Unknown (4/30/25 12:16 PM): That's good. That's good that's good question.

- Unknown (4/30/25 12:16 PM): Like what if we tell them that hey, this is another option Nash.

- Unknown (4/30/25 12:16 PM): That's really good question.

- Unknown (4/30/25 12:16 PM): There's a pass through cost involved with it, which is like you have to 70 cents or 7 cents, whatever it is that we pay Nash, the vendor has to pay it, nobody's going to take it.

- Unknown (4/30/25 12:16 PM): That's a really good question. That is a really good question because if they decide not to go with it then we don't have to do anything.

- Unknown (4/30/25 12:16 PM): Yeah. But we can offer Nash.

- Unknown (4/30/25 12:16 PM): Yeah. Because the pass through cost you could just be like, hey, you can use Nash, but the 70 cents we need to we someone needs to help, you know, bridge that gap.

- Unknown (4/30/25 12:16 PM): There's ways to get around this contractually, we just have to

- Unknown (4/30/25 12:16 PM): But what about that? I think that's a really good good play. Hey, we we are begging them to take Nash, but they won't take it.

- Unknown (4/30/25 12:17 PM): And that can happen with any routing as well, right?

- Unknown (4/30/25 12:17 PM): It'll be three prongs which it'll be you can use Nash's recommended not not the recommendation. Nash can be utilized for a service cost through. And then what else would the other ones be?

- Unknown (4/30/25 12:17 PM): Spark.

- Unknown (4/30/25 12:17 PM): And then we also include the third, which is driver is able to skip and bypass apps.

- Unknown (4/30/25 12:17 PM): So that's so that's something that I can turn I don't know if I can turn it on just for dedicated delivery, but I'm thinking I can turn on for just for dedicated delivery. But um that option is nuclear.

- Unknown (4/30/25 12:17 PM): And so turn off the ability the allow them to to skip to the next one. So technically, let me let me tell you this and I'm going to tell you how I'll lower it up. Technically, your Spark is supposed to do that.

- Unknown (4/30/25 12:18 PM): It it there's no feature to allow for them to do that, but they're supposed to be able to go to the next one because you're not supposed to be able to dictate for the independent contractor how to deliver the packages. But their team has said, yeah, it's there, but none of the lawyers have ever driven and used that. So it's not there that functionality doesn't exist or it's not turned on because engineering doesn't understand why we would do that because it would increase cost.

- Unknown (4/30/25 12:18 PM): But it's something that I can explore and ask and ask to turn on.

- Unknown (4/30/25 12:18 PM): Like a quick little paragraph on Nash, Spark, and then C would be driver determined routing.

- Unknown (4/30/25 12:18 PM): Yeah, because there's nothing that says, hey, you guys run this route every single day and you know that it takes longer to get to this house than the one on number four. Just skip it.

- Unknown (4/30/25 12:18 PM): Yeah. And that would just be that would be a feature enhancement that we would need for dedicated delivery and probably be easier to um get prioritized, I guess, in a way. But um yeah, so I would I would say that. But I I really like your Nash idea. If we say, hey, we're providing Nash, but no one wants to take it.

- Unknown (4/30/25 12:19 PM): Then that's on vendors and that's not on us.

- Unknown (4/30/25 12:19 PM): That's the whole point of routing app. Even if we get a new routing app and they want to use something else, that's

- Unknown (4/30/25 12:19 PM): Well the whole thing is is that to be honest, the new the new app does nothing for routing other than because his I think he should change his his claim is he doesn't want a Walmart branded. Want to Spark driver using Walmart. I and I hate that he's using that with leadership because I keep hearing routing and the initial conversation has nothing to do with routing. Routing is done in the back end.

- Unknown (4/30/25 12:19 PM): Routing isn't a front end app. It has nothing to do with an app. It's just the app is the in the driver experience. Routing is a plan that comes from before you even create the trip, right? So they keep if he's telling leadership that it's the routing concern, like we're not working on routing. We weren't working on routing. Now I'm working on routing, but we were never working on routing to begin with. It's always been that they're using the Spark app and they're using a Spark app and they're using the Spark flow. Like routing this is something that I'm imagining that he's come upon and continue to drive to leadership, which is confusing the hell out of leadership because I don't think leadership understands that routing is a is a function that's two things upstream before you even get to the app.

- Unknown (4/30/25 12:20 PM): Maybe we got to just we'll do two things. We'll create slide A that says what it looks like now and how the infrastructure and and user experience, whatever.

- Unknown (4/30/25 12:20 PM): We want to add in there. And then he just said.

- Unknown (4/30/25 12:20 PM): Yeah.

- Unknown (4/30/25 12:20 PM): Might be will be from a legal contractual perspective, the primary concern is parent routing.

- Unknown (4/30/25 12:20 PM): Here are three solutions that allow the driver to select how they would like to perform deliveries.

- Unknown (4/30/25 12:21 PM): through Nash for a cost, through Spark for no cost and or their own skipping.

- Unknown (4/30/25 12:21 PM): And and and do make it look similar. We can say that even for Spark there's a cost, they pay us routing fee.

- Unknown (4/30/25 12:21 PM): So we keep them on the same terms. The Nash cost is whatever the vendor charges them, whatever Nash charges.

- Unknown (4/30/25 12:21 PM): See, and and that's the other thing that we don't know, right? Because I'm imagining, I'm imagining that I'm just giving everyone the benefit of the doubt.

- Unknown (4/30/25 12:21 PM): I'm imagining that the bloated cost that they see for Nash isn't because of uh isn't because they're super bad at contracting.

- Unknown (4/30/25 12:21 PM): What I would imagine is is that someone has to onboard with Nash, then they have to onboard with us, and then they have to and then we have to pay a 70 cents per package fee.

- Unknown (4/30/25 12:21 PM): So, I'm imagining that's why the cost is so bloated. Um and I think but like I said, for I like your idea, but if you know, legal is legal, right?

- Unknown (4/30/25 12:22 PM): I I don't mind. I don't I think we should we should say, what, forget it, we're all in on Nash. They can have their own routing.

- Unknown (4/30/25 12:22 PM): And then we have all of this reason like to say like to prioritize. Like my whole thing is to prioritize, right?

- Unknown (4/30/25 12:22 PM): Because if you if I have now our contracts are 400, $450 per van, and we still need to use it for AE, but we're all in on Nash.

- Unknown (4/30/25 12:22 PM): Um like then I can say, oh, but we can bring it down to 350 where we were before with this new app, then it makes it that much better. And then you then you protect the customer experience and associate experience because I'm telling you right now,

- Unknown (4/30/25 12:22 PM): associates hate Nash, Uber, point pickup, they hate it all because it's it's bad for their business because it's just a it doesn't look the same.

- Unknown (4/30/25 12:22 PM): should be meeting with you and and we're going to draft something and send it to So, I think Josh on that note, I think what we did in September was that these questions kept coming in what we last year.

- Unknown (4/30/25 12:23 PM): Are we all on a Oh, yeah. Do we have people? I moved it. Okay.

- Unknown (4/30/25 12:23 PM): So, yeah, so what we uh did on September was basically uh legal came up with all the concerns that they have with our program and we got on extensive conversations with them and that's how we created the document, which is like what are the pointers that legal suggest are risky, non-risky, red red yellow green. And then we chose everything that was green and that gave us the go ahead for 200 vans.

- Unknown (4/30/25 12:23 PM): How about we ask them for the similar list for the riskier states, the question that you asked them, like something in writing that what are your concerns?

- Unknown (4/30/25 12:23 PM): So my thing is is for that, we're just going to keep going around in circles. I think our I think what we need to do is get Side and uh and well yeah, Side and Rebecca aligned to what the actual problem statements that we're hearing from from legal.

- Unknown (4/30/25 12:24 PM): problem is I think in the past because of us not working collaboratively with them, Sarah had uh Kieran's ear.

- Unknown (4/30/25 12:24 PM): And I I think if you remember I mentioned that, you know, like she is pushing our case that we're working closely with her and we're creating a program that's risk averse.

- Unknown (4/30/25 12:24 PM): is that they would say that, you know, it's a business decision, but the moment we take that business decision, they're going to flag it at Kieran's level.

- Unknown (4/30/25 12:24 PM): Well, that's but that's what I'm saying is because to his point, we don't have it plainly listed of what the problem statement that we're hearing from them. Like we should say, hey, it's it's a Walmart brand. Well, well, if it's if it's a Walmart branded deal, we need to act because the whole issue is is Walmart branded or we need to use Nash and it's going to cost X amount X amount of money.

- Unknown (4/30/25 12:24 PM): If the issue is parent routing, we have we have parent routing, but the driver can either select their own thing, we can use Nash or we rework that document and Yeah, I think we just need to have them all aligned so when they go up there and we're having a conversation with Karen, it's just like, hey, this these are the two problem statements because I think there's just two. There's Walmart branded.

- Unknown (4/30/25 12:25 PM): What's the name? And which one do we feel which one do we feel uh so strongly about? You can't Walmart branded and use that stupid word parent routing.

- Unknown (4/30/25 12:25 PM): Parent routing. All right, we're going to have a meeting just you think Mario and us need to be involved in this? And just us three girls.

- Unknown (4/30/25 12:25 PM): Uh, when is this?

- Unknown (4/30/25 12:25 PM): I'm going to have it for later on today.

- Unknown (4/30/25 12:25 PM): Uh, I mean, you can add them as optional, I guess.

- Unknown (4/30/25 12:25 PM): Actually, that's what we'll do the whole thing that we need.

- Unknown (4/30/25 12:25 PM): Okay.

- Unknown (4/30/25 12:25 PM): and you're free at three, right?

- Unknown (4/30/25 12:25 PM): leave early today.

- Unknown (4/30/25 12:26 PM): Yeah, it's literally like next week.

- Unknown (4/30/25 12:26 PM): What happened?

- Unknown (4/30/25 12:26 PM): I think we're grabbing lunch. What's up?

- Unknown (4/30/25 12:26 PM): Hold up. Are you going to are you going in person? Oh, we have to go in person.

- Unknown (4/30/25 12:26 PM): Second floor only, right?

- Unknown (4/30/25 12:26 PM): Yeah, we'll go in person.

- Unknown (4/30/25 12:26 PM): See how it's going to be a new one.

- Unknown (4/30/25 12:26 PM): Oh, should have got that combo last.

- Unknown (4/30/25 12:26 PM): I drafted a contract for Samsung delivering big and bulky items like damage homes, fall on drivers and are worth 1800, two grand a piece.

- Unknown (4/30/25 12:26 PM): Whatever whatever predictions he's talking about, Amazon has all of these things. You can skip routing or do whatever with Amazon's routing. The Rabbit app does not say Amazon anywhere. There's no Amazon branding in Rabbit app.

- Unknown (4/30/25 12:27 PM): Well, and I mean Amazon is not protected.

- Unknown (4/30/25 12:27 PM): Well, that's true.

- Unknown (4/30/25 12:27 PM): That's a good point. That's what I was trying to bring up is like once we get this app, what next? We're still are going to face the same issues in California. If people want to sue, they will.

- Unknown (4/30/25 12:27 PM): Yeah.

- Unknown (4/30/25 12:27 PM): People, yeah, people are they're going to sue.

- Unknown (4/30/25 12:27 PM): As as food as we become big enough in the state, we are going to get sued. There's no there's no the drivers are being paid $15 an hour. There's it's very easy for any union to come and ask them that hey, like like add your name in and we'll get you we'll get you.

- Unknown (4/30/25 12:27 PM): And the in a beautiful way.

- Unknown (4/30/25 12:27 PM): thing is is that we are I mean we have that separation where Amazon doesn't have that separation. And I don't know if you know why we keep just looking at Amazon, FedEx and UPS. They haven't been using the employee model exclusively or really what did they they shut down the UPS uh employee model like for quite some time.

- Unknown (4/30/25 12:28 PM): So like I don't understand like what the issue is.

- Unknown (4/30/25 12:28 PM): I mean, he explained his issue. He's pretty much risk averse.

- Unknown (4/30/25 12:28 PM): Yeah.

- Unknown (4/30/25 12:28 PM): It's it's not the fact that there's problems is just him. I'm risk averse.

- Unknown (4/30/25 12:28 PM): Yeah.

- Unknown (4/30/25 12:28 PM): I'm not I don't want to go to court and have to actually do my job.

- Unknown (4/30/25 12:28 PM): As I as I was listening as I was listening, I was like, shit, I should have just went to law school. Convince people not to do stuff.

- Unknown (4/30/25 12:28 PM): That's free information for us to know.

- Unknown (4/30/25 12:28 PM): Because if I share if I share with you, you'll share it with Carrie before Ross share with.

- Unknown (4/30/25 12:28 PM): I share with you, it'll be all the same shit that was in your scope of work.

- Unknown (4/30/25 12:28 PM): That that was that was a wild statement like I can you share? Like we can talk about it, but I can't share it with you because then you'll arm your leadership to second guess a decision like them. Well, if it's a business decision, but you're saying that you're going to tell the the COO to not go with it.

- Unknown (4/30/25 12:29 PM): All all the reason he doesn't want to share is simply put like the state laws that are literally had in that document are the same information that he's getting from the consultant saying this is why these states are risky.

- Unknown (4/30/25 12:29 PM): There's no other reason.

- Unknown (4/30/25 12:29 PM): Yeah.

- Unknown (4/30/25 12:29 PM): We were examples of how states have been sued by certain laws or people have sued based off of certain state laws.

- Unknown (4/30/25 12:29 PM): Yeah.

- Unknown (4/30/25 12:29 PM): Yeah, just uh list of cases that were brought up and are open.

- Unknown (4/30/25 12:29 PM): we don't even know how they how they won.

- Unknown (4/30/25 12:29 PM): And I kind of want to keep pushing the uh.

- Unknown (4/30/25 12:29 PM): Hi, hello. How I I found the team.

- Unknown (4/30/25 12:29 PM): Nice to meet you.

- Unknown (4/30/25 12:29 PM): Yeah, I was sit second floor, yes.

- Unknown (4/30/25 12:30 PM): I was connecting with the analytics.

- Unknown (4/30/25 12:30 PM): Yeah.

- Unknown (4/30/25 12:30 PM): Okay.

- Unknown (4/30/25 12:30 PM): Awesome.

- Unknown (4/30/25 12:30 PM): Massachusetts or?

- Unknown (4/30/25 12:30 PM): Yeah, I'm Boston.

- Unknown (4/30/25 12:30 PM): Oh, sorry, Boston.

- Unknown (4/30/25 12:30 PM): Yeah.

- Unknown (4/30/25 12:30 PM): You got off a legal call right now.

- Unknown (4/30/25 12:30 PM): talking about states.

- Unknown (4/30/25 12:30 PM): Massachusetts, you're right, 100%.

- Unknown (4/30/25 12:30 PM): these are all mostly the DSP that we want out of here.

- Unknown (4/30/25 12:30 PM): the tech and process.

- Unknown (4/30/25 12:30 PM): So there's and the invoicing.

- Unknown (4/30/25 12:30 PM): right now no because my manager and my kids are yeah.

- Unknown (4/30/25 12:31 PM): I sit with Michael Roberts and yeah. And then.

- Unknown (4/30/25 12:31 PM): So only you then from Michael's team here?

- Unknown (4/30/25 12:31 PM): No, no. Michael Roberts are also there.

- Unknown (4/30/25 12:31 PM): Okay.

- Unknown (4/30/25 12:31 PM): six people over there of the Michael Roberts.

- Unknown (4/30/25 12:31 PM): Looking forward to working with you and doing cool stuff together and knowing you about all the data we need.

- Unknown (4/30/25 12:31 PM): What said tell you.

- Unknown (4/30/25 12:31 PM): had a highlight and she said, oh, same problem here. I'll annoy her first like with like tons of questions. They have the same issue with the like the invoicing issue that we have. They have the same issue.

- Unknown (4/30/25 12:31 PM): Oh, really? Oh, dang, I thought we were going to get it fixed just.

- Unknown (4/30/25 12:32 PM): So your data tables are.

- Unknown (4/30/25 12:32 PM): Uh we share with the team and we use and uh for this. similar because uh we're DSP so there's always like smaller people that just don't match and then metrics don't match.

- Unknown (4/30/25 12:32 PM): third party dash. They have their own dashboards. Yeah, yeah. And it's not integrated into Walmart system.

- Unknown (4/30/25 12:32 PM): Oh, it's not.

- Unknown (4/30/25 12:32 PM): No, it's not yet. Yeah.

- Unknown (4/30/25 12:32 PM): Is there a priority prioritization uh.

- Unknown (4/30/25 12:32 PM): That's kind of my current.

- Unknown (4/30/25 12:32 PM): Two years online.

- Unknown (4/30/25 12:32 PM): Is it true that you guys spend point well that we spend 0.77 per dash each order, each delivery?

- Unknown (4/30/25 12:32 PM): Cuz I I don't know. I don't know but. Yeah, yeah, I join in March.

- Unknown (4/30/25 12:33 PM): Okay.

- Unknown (4/30/25 12:33 PM): Yeah, I'm not just somewhere. We try to sync the data with.

- Unknown (4/30/25 12:33 PM): They are here. They will be here like next week or something.

- Unknown (4/30/25 12:33 PM): Really? Nash?

- Unknown (4/30/25 12:33 PM): Yeah, yeah.

- Unknown (4/30/25 12:33 PM): Nice.

- Unknown (4/30/25 12:33 PM): Yeah, we do. I don't know if uh we'll now we'll they will include but like yeah, but they will discuss the data sync as well.

- Unknown (4/30/25 12:33 PM): Awesome.

- Unknown (4/30/25 12:33 PM): Nice to meet you.

- Unknown (4/30/25 12:33 PM): Yes, nice to meet you.

- Unknown (4/30/25 12:33 PM): No, no, no.

- Unknown (4/30/25 12:33 PM): Thank you guys.

- Unknown (4/30/25 12:33 PM): Thank you.

- Unknown (4/30/25 12:34 PM): Walmart out.

- Unknown (4/30/25 12:34 PM): What what can he say?

- Unknown (4/30/25 12:34 PM): What would be what would be his rebuttal? Cuz everything he just said.

- Unknown (4/30/25 12:34 PM): Well, these markets are still risky, Josh and Hakeem and California has laws.

- Unknown (4/30/25 12:35 PM): Hey.

- Unknown (4/30/25 12:35 PM): I I I I say well, one, we have to figure out, you know, if we can actually do it because as as this point.

- Unknown (4/30/25 12:35 PM): I'm hearing that there's no LOA, but I always hear that there's no LOA.

- Unknown (4/30/25 12:35 PM): Hey, and then there's significant LOA.

- Unknown (4/30/25 12:35 PM): Expand then some way, somehow.

- Unknown (4/30/25 12:35 PM): Mhm. Problem statement. Walmart branded and parent routing.

- Unknown (4/30/25 12:35 PM): Mhm.

- Unknown (4/30/25 12:35 PM): How does routing work, Hakeem?

- Unknown (4/30/25 12:35 PM): Nash, Spark, driver routing, contractual scenarios written.

- Unknown (4/30/25 12:35 PM): Red, yellow, green requirements. Josh, I'm going to get that from him but all the research he's gotten given to him on the side that says these states are risky because of state laws.

- Unknown (4/30/25 12:35 PM): So one thing we'll need help on is I know how I know the flow for Spark.

- Unknown (4/30/25 12:35 PM): The driver part, I mean, we can just put, you know, make it so they can do unlimited.

- Unknown (4/30/25 12:36 PM): I mean your yeah, your analogy was like a perfect example. Yeah. You can put in the GPS ABCD, but if you're like, yeah, there's traffic here, let me move it.

- Unknown (4/30/25 12:36 PM): So the skipping like that part I'll just we can just white paper or how that would not white paper, but just put something how that would look. The only thing we need help with is Nash. I I mean, other than what what, you know, we've talked about, that's all I know.

- Unknown (4/30/25 12:36 PM): So it may be good for us to speak with Mike Roberts.

- Unknown (4/30/25 12:36 PM): We set up a meeting with him?

- Unknown (4/30/25 12:36 PM): We should.

- Unknown (4/30/25 12:36 PM): Let me see.

- Unknown (4/30/25 12:36 PM): I don't know he had direct reports though.

- Unknown (4/30/25 12:36 PM): He just kept saying the same thing. I was like I was like I don't understand. You just said router was an issue. So if the driver can route themselves, what's what's the issue? So is your issue that it says Walmart or is your issue that there's parent routing?

- Unknown (4/30/25 12:37 PM): He dropped it in the and then he can't wiggle his way out.

- Unknown (4/30/25 12:37 PM): Yeah. The corner like you have.

- Unknown (4/30/25 12:37 PM): Okay, so Mike Roberts.

- Unknown (4/30/25 12:37 PM): He only has two direct reports.

- Unknown (4/30/25 12:37 PM): James must be the one that I met.

- Unknown (4/30/25 12:37 PM): What's up?

- Unknown (4/30/25 12:37 PM): the new trailer is pushed to eight.

- Unknown (4/30/25 12:37 PM): Eight what?

- Unknown (4/30/25 12:37 PM): Why why did they move it forward to move it back?

- Unknown (4/30/25 12:37 PM): Why?

- Unknown (4/30/25 12:37 PM): Why? Because um there are no trailers from PX92 Houston on sixth.

- Unknown (4/30/25 12:37 PM): I thought that was the reason that they moved it to the sixth.

- Unknown (4/30/25 12:37 PM): No, no, they moved it to the sixth because they don't want it to clash with IP store launches.

- Unknown (4/30/25 12:38 PM): Okay. And the have a lot of.

- Unknown (4/30/25 12:38 PM): Okay.

- Unknown (4/30/25 12:38 PM): We we.

- Unknown (4/30/25 12:38 PM): Wait, wait, wait, wait. We are still discussing. Don't confirm.

- Unknown (4/30/25 12:38 PM): But we should be doing the same team. We need a final date by end of day.

- Unknown (4/30/25 12:38 PM): I don't care what the date is. Just give me a date.

- Unknown (4/30/25 12:38 PM): final confirmation because the vendor requires.

- Unknown (4/30/25 12:38 PM): But I don't think I can mess with size together, right?

- Unknown (4/30/25 12:38 PM): Why not? Why not?

- Unknown (4/30/25 12:38 PM): You scared?

- Unknown (4/30/25 12:38 PM): Yeah, why are you scared?

- Unknown (4/30/25 12:38 PM): I'll see you.

- Unknown (4/30/25 12:38 PM): Yeah.

- Unknown (4/30/25 12:38 PM): I'll say.

- Unknown (4/30/25 12:38 PM): Josh is not going to.

- Unknown (4/30/25 12:38 PM): Do you do you do you know what I say to people who are two levels above me all day?

- Unknown (4/30/25 12:38 PM): Josh is as.

- Unknown (4/30/25 12:38 PM): That's the final.

- Unknown (4/30/25 12:38 PM): What's up?

- Unknown (4/30/25 12:38 PM): What's that? What is that?

- Unknown (4/30/25 12:38 PM): 3196.

- Unknown (4/30/25 12:38 PM): Ooh. And that's half of one order.

- Unknown (4/30/25 12:39 PM): We strive to deliver everything we can.

- Unknown (4/30/25 12:39 PM): I think the driver made a mistake there. He he he removed that and kept yeah. I mean, I mean uh personally, I I rebuke that.

- Unknown (4/30/25 12:39 PM): No, personally, I I like that because my CPD is going to look good. Well, but that's just. But no, but but in reality, yeah, no one's going to be able to take that batch and that's going to have to be picked up by a customer, which I'd imagine that those are all DFS orders. So honestly, the customer can come pick that up.

- Unknown (4/30/25 12:39 PM): I said it could be.

- Unknown (4/30/25 12:39 PM): Yeah, it's not going to be a problem. They're going to come first that's to pick up. Uh when you see it wrapped in bags like that, that means it's a DFS order.

- Unknown (4/30/25 12:39 PM): No problem.

- Unknown (4/30/25 12:39 PM): But definitely they made the wrong call. They should take they should take the order.

- Unknown (4/30/25 12:40 PM): Oh, let's see.

- Unknown (4/30/25 12:40 PM): One side of you back and you say surprise.

- Unknown (4/30/25 12:40 PM): I'll side to come back and I'll be able to say surprise.

- Unknown (4/30/25 12:40 PM): Legal's aligned with us spending 700 bags in California.

- Unknown (4/30/25 12:40 PM): ultimately all it is is just a convincing game. all we're doing is sharing with him what he needs to share with Sarah, which then talk we talk with if we convince him, he'll convince Sarah.

- Unknown (4/30/25 12:40 PM): And that's it. Yeah. Oh, I I have no doubt that Nav is going to be able to convince Sarah.

- Unknown (4/30/25 12:40 PM): No doubt.

- Unknown (4/30/25 12:40 PM): I think it's more of us just explaining what his problems is, which I may have already explained what his problems is.

- Unknown (4/30/25 12:40 PM): But I think that it's so convoluted because I don't think I don't think they knew what they were talking about.

- Unknown (4/30/25 12:41 PM): Oh yeah, it's like that stupid telephone game. say one thing about time it gets downstream it's changed.

- Unknown (4/30/25 12:41 PM): Because I I have no doubt that Sai knows what he's talking about, but I but I think when they have those closer meetings,

- Unknown (4/30/25 12:41 PM): they're just throwing out terms and shit.

- Unknown (4/30/25 12:41 PM): provide a route or a brand route.

- Unknown (4/30/25 12:41 PM): Cuz that's why I was so confused when uh Carolyn said uh, do we even want to provide a route?

- Unknown (4/30/25 12:41 PM): Like in what last mile delivery business where you're trying to influence contracting, would you not want to at least provide an initial route?

- Unknown (4/30/25 12:41 PM): Like at that point you have no leverage.

- Unknown (4/30/25 12:41 PM): Here's 400 packages. Get it done.

- Unknown (4/30/25 12:41 PM): I was like you indeed. What you like legitimately what you just like that's when I keep I keep not understanding how they understand this. legitimately said, hey, we want to take back away from UPS and FedEx and just create a new UPS at the last mile. Let's just do that.

- Unknown (4/30/25 12:42 PM): Amazon app by chance?

- Unknown (4/30/25 12:42 PM): I don't, but Nitan does from um our friend or his old boss from Amazon.

- Unknown (4/30/25 12:42 PM): Oh.

- Unknown (4/30/25 12:42 PM): Mhm.

- Unknown (4/30/25 12:42 PM): He's hilarious.

- Unknown (4/30/25 12:42 PM): We need to set up another meeting with him. But we should do it at like uh

- Unknown (4/30/25 12:42 PM): in Brazil.

- Unknown (4/30/25 12:42 PM): Oh, I'm definitely.

- Unknown (4/30/25 12:43 PM): Bro, it's like in Nashville.

- Unknown (4/30/25 12:43 PM): I can't convince people I don't play in the NFL in Nashville because I mean everyone's down there drunk on freaking uh on their bachelor bachelorette party. You're like, you play in the NFL. I'm like, no, no, I don't. You play. I'm like, no. Freaking bottles coming out, stuff like that. And it was it was terrible. Like I literally had to like bring my wife off of people. She's like, don't touch cuz you know, it'd be like like oh shit.

- Unknown (4/30/25 12:44 PM): We had to move out of Nashville pretty quick.

- Unknown (4/30/25 12:44 PM): It fixes real funny.

- Unknown (4/30/25 12:44 PM): I mean it wasn't broken.

- Unknown (4/30/25 12:44 PM): Well, you figured out.

- Unknown (4/30/25 12:44 PM): Yeah, I figured out how to turn it on. It wasn't broken. I've been hibachi almost every day. I think yesterday was the only day we didn't we didn't hibachi.

- Unknown (4/30/25 12:44 PM): Now what the bad thing is, the bad thing is I think my I think it's getting low the um the propane because I tried to turn it on the other day and it's while it's while like uh my almost one year old was out there and my wife's out there. And then I'm like, I'm like, I can't it didn't work. So I started turning the knobs and shit. I burst it and it's a slight one. So it wasn't quite quite the jump, but it was like.

- Unknown (4/30/25 12:45 PM): Oh man.

- Unknown (4/30/25 12:45 PM): Oh.

- Unknown (4/30/25 12:45 PM): We're going to brand that.

- Unknown (4/30/25 12:46 PM): See? It's like Photoshop Josh, it's not.

- Unknown (4/30/25 12:49 PM): I don't know what you're going to have on this.

- Unknown (4/30/25 12:49 PM): I don't know again, I have never had this before.

- Unknown (4/30/25 12:49 PM): at some point maybe.

- Unknown (4/30/25 12:49 PM): I don't know, my wife or someone has to put in for my.

- Unknown (4/30/25 12:51 PM): I was hoping it would be back.

- Unknown (4/30/25 12:51 PM): We're going to walk over.

- Unknown (4/30/25 12:51 PM): Oh, perfect.

- Unknown (4/30/25 12:51 PM): better than salmon.

- Unknown (4/30/25 12:51 PM): Hey, what's too long?

- Unknown (4/30/25 12:51 PM): It's too long.

- Unknown (4/30/25 12:51 PM): I said I've been I've been on my quest 3.15 miles every day.

- Unknown (4/30/25 12:52 PM): Yeah, man.

- Unknown (4/30/25 12:52 PM): If I got it in me, I'll try to hoop.

- Unknown (4/30/25 12:52 PM): How do you go in there?

- Unknown (4/30/25 12:52 PM): Yeah, I go down there. I can I can down there. I get it in.

- Unknown (4/30/25 12:52 PM): Sometimes.

- Unknown (4/30/25 12:52 PM): Depends on how my knees feel.

- Unknown (4/30/25 12:52 PM): Right.

- Unknown (4/30/25 12:52 PM): about to go to that treadmill.

- Unknown (4/30/25 12:52 PM): knees, just plus everything else.

- Unknown (4/30/25 12:52 PM): Luckily I got out of my my my Achilles is there killing me from from doing them doing all these uh 5Ks, but.

- Unknown (4/30/25 12:52 PM): Yeah, well, when it hurt too much, I'll just start I'll just start walking. I'm like, I'll walk it out. I'm going get it in though.

- Unknown (4/30/25 12:52 PM): I can I can feel the difference though. I'm spinning and stuff. I ain't spin with a basketball in so long.

- Unknown (4/30/25 12:52 PM): Mess around and be dunking.

- Unknown (4/30/25 12:52 PM): Hey, mess around. Now they only get one out of me cuz what's what's my knees realize what I'm trying to do.

- Unknown (4/30/25 12:53 PM): Anthony Edwards out there.

- Unknown (4/30/25 12:53 PM): Man, Anthony Edwards. Oh man, yeah.

- Unknown (4/30/25 12:53 PM): I'm I'm going to see them Lakers go down tonight.

- Unknown (4/30/25 12:53 PM): Oh yeah, they going down.

- Unknown (4/30/25 12:53 PM): No, I've uh I've been I usually go to sleep at 9:00, but the the good games are always at it's so late. I'm like, what is this?

- Unknown (4/30/25 12:53 PM): Oh man, it's killing me.

- Unknown (4/30/25 12:53 PM): Cuz it was uh Golden State. I stayed up and watched that one and going to bed to about 11:00.

- Unknown (4/30/25 12:53 PM): Yeah, four of them come on tonight. Uhhuh. But uh Golden State comes on early though. They come on like 7:00.

- Unknown (4/30/25 12:53 PM): Oh yeah, I can at least I'm going watch that one. The Lakers the Lakers I might have to hear about it again.

- Unknown (4/30/25 12:53 PM): I fell asleep during the um during the Denver game last night.

- Unknown (4/30/25 12:53 PM): I couldn't finish it.

- Unknown (4/30/25 12:53 PM): I said I I wake up in the middle of the night anyway, right? And then check it.

- Unknown (4/30/25 12:53 PM): That's exactly how I woke up. I you know what I'm saying? They win. And yeah.

- Unknown (4/30/25 12:53 PM): Yeah.

- Unknown (4/30/25 12:53 PM): Yeah.

- Unknown (4/30/25 12:53 PM): Oh nuggets.

- Unknown (4/30/25 12:53 PM): Hey that close game when I was watching. They going back and forth.

- Unknown (4/30/25 12:54 PM): Oh yeah. No, um I'm surprised. Well, I'm not surprised. Westbrook.

- Unknown (4/30/25 12:54 PM): He's changing it up.

- Unknown (4/30/25 12:54 PM): There it is. He hit him three. He found the jumper.

- Unknown (4/30/25 12:54 PM): He he was sitting it from the uh from the not even not only from the corner cuz usually the corner is a sweet spot.

- Unknown (4/30/25 12:54 PM): Yeah, sweet spot. Yeah, yeah.

- Unknown (4/30/25 12:54 PM): But he was he was sitting it from the side. I was like the side. Okay.

- Unknown (4/30/25 12:54 PM): Yeah, he found the chopper, man. That's right.

- Unknown (4/30/25 12:54 PM): But he looked he looked good like like uh when I was looking at him, I'm like, man, he looked small cuz he usually got a little girth on him. Yeah. But he looked like he'd been just working out and getting it in.

- Unknown (4/30/25 12:54 PM): You know when you're not starting and playing 25 minutes.

- Unknown (4/30/25 12:54 PM): That's true.

- Unknown (4/30/25 12:54 PM): 25 minutes a night.

- Unknown (4/30/25 12:54 PM): He's been on that bike. He's been on that bike.

- Unknown (4/30/25 12:54 PM): He only playing 25 minutes. That's a big difference.

- Unknown (4/30/25 12:54 PM): Hey he he getting he he getting a lot of he had what 20 points and you know, 16 minutes something.

- Unknown (4/30/25 12:54 PM): Well that one he hit that three.

- Unknown (4/30/25 12:54 PM): Yeah. I was like, what is this going on? Now he's shooting it freely like here. He got that confidence.

- Unknown (4/30/25 12:55 PM): Well now I'm I'm rooting for I've been rooting for Denver cuz I'm like, man, they pull that off.

- Unknown (4/30/25 12:55 PM): I mean, looking real good though.

- Unknown (4/30/25 12:55 PM): I think I want the.

- Unknown (4/30/25 12:55 PM): I'm not sure.

- Unknown (4/30/25 12:55 PM): I think I have the confidence in the Denver coach than.

- Unknown (4/30/25 12:55 PM): Yeah, I mean, that dude just out there coach right before the playoffs.

- Unknown (4/30/25 12:55 PM): They got he got he just his interviews are hilarious cuz he said he looked like he ain't supposed to be there.

- Unknown (4/30/25 12:55 PM): Like yeah, we played basketball. We we ran up and down the court. We did what we supposed to do.

- Unknown (4/30/25 12:55 PM): I'm not sure that's a that's a.

- Unknown (4/30/25 12:55 PM): I'm not sure that's a recipe for success when you get to the better team in the West.

- Unknown (4/30/25 12:55 PM): Yeah. Oh yeah.

- Unknown (4/30/25 12:55 PM): I mean they they have they have absolutely little chance against anybody else if they struggling this hard against uh.

- Unknown (4/30/25 12:55 PM): Well, you ain't no slouch or no coach.

- Unknown (4/30/25 12:55 PM): No, he's not. He's not.

- Unknown (4/30/25 12:55 PM): I'm just talking about like when you take about all the all the talent that they have there, like adjustments.

- Unknown (4/30/25 12:56 PM): I mean cuz they don't have a deep team, so you kind of like for Denver, you you kind of have to be firing on all cylinders.

- Unknown (4/30/25 12:56 PM): Yeah, but once they man playing well, you ain't playing well. really got much of a chance.

- Unknown (4/30/25 12:56 PM): I mean, to be fair, he's not playing well is like him scoring 30 points. Everybody was like, he he didn't play he didn't play a good game. 30 points, 20 assists.

- Unknown (4/30/25 12:56 PM): 15 boards.

- Unknown (4/30/25 12:56 PM): Terrible game.

- Unknown (4/30/25 12:56 PM): But you set that standard and that's what.

- Unknown (4/30/25 12:56 PM): Yeah.

- Unknown (4/30/25 12:56 PM): everybody else.

- Unknown (4/30/25 12:56 PM): Yeah, he's just.

- Unknown (4/30/25 1:03 PM): Okay, I don't think we had the sound.

- Unknown (4/30/25 1:03 PM): Can you check sound? Yes, it's ours today.

- Unknown (4/30/25 1:03 PM): Okay, we're good.

- Unknown (4/30/25 1:03 PM): thumbs up.

- Unknown (4/30/25 1:03 PM): Oh, it's Robbie. Robbie, if you can hear us, give us a thumbs up.

- Unknown (4/30/25 1:03 PM): Thank you.

- Unknown (4/30/25 1:03 PM): If you can hear us, thank you.

- Unknown (4/30/25 1:03 PM): Welcome team. This is our first last mile delivery town hall. Also, we just celebrated that town hall. So let's start every meeting town hall meeting. So everyone.

- Unknown (4/30/25 1:04 PM): Hey.

- Unknown (4/30/25 1:04 PM): Squiggly.

- Unknown (4/30/25 1:04 PM): Squiggly.

- Unknown (4/30/25 1:04 PM): Yeah, I don't know just start using man.

- Unknown (4/30/25 1:04 PM): Hey, how you doing?

- Unknown (4/30/25 1:04 PM): Let's get start using man.

- Unknown (4/30/25 1:04 PM): so I'm going to turn it over to Bert and then we're going to start our meeting with walking us through the Walmart US strategy. And then after that then we're going to turn it over to Rebecca and then we're going to cover the last mile delivery strategy for this year as well. Does that sounds like a plan?

- Unknown (4/30/25 1:04 PM): All right, let's jump right in. I'm going to share to you all how to be. Uh so I'm Burton McColl, I'm part of the Walmart US strategy team. Uh recently or relatively recently I joined in Thanksgiving or so. And large part of my role is about being able to crystallize the strategy that we're trying to support in order to get our overall goals in Walmart US. So walking through essentially what we call our customer value proposition, what our goals and our approaches for this year.

- Unknown (4/30/25 1:05 PM): I'm going to go through this. We'll try to go in depth and also try to make it particularly applicable for you all. There are questions along the way, feel free to stop us. I know it's a large group, but uh just best that we can.

- Unknown (4/30/25 1:05 PM): So, this slide here, um really is to capture what we're trying to accomplish. Very tough, people at tech powered on the channel retailer. Hopefully you all have seen this many times before and recited in your sleep. I don't think we need to go into this. I will say though that I used to think it's a little bit cheesy to be honest when I first started. But I honestly believe it that it captures everything we're trying to do and that we really are out there trying to help people save money and live better and if we do that, we will achieve our goals as a company as well. And to me it's the very best way of measuring how we are doing to achieving our goals long term is around the concept of first place wallet share.

- Unknown (4/30/25 1:06 PM): So, again, many of you may understand or know what first place wallet share is. So I'll go over it really quickly because I think it's really important. First place wallet share is often expressed as a percentage because it tends to show the percentage of our customers who spend more money with us Walmart than any other retailer out there. Okay, so in other words, we're looking at share of wallet, how much they have to spend total retail and how much are they spending with us and we still count who's spending more with us than anybody else.

- Unknown (4/30/25 1:06 PM): It means really important because that is a measure of the depth of the relationship that we have with the customers. And can be thought of also as a really indicator for either growth trajectory of our sales or potentially decline as well. And that's something therefore is something we're really careful about this because we want to win, not just in not just in specific categories in certain channels, but across the board.

- Unknown (4/30/25 1:07 PM): So, everything we're trying to do is to get first place wallet share. How are we going to go about that? That's where the how to win comes into play. Hopefully you all have also heard about assortment price experience and trust. That's what we call our customer value competition. I'm going to go a little bit more detail there. Assortment price experience we come together and how we take care of the customers. In my own words I'd say the items the customers want the most at the very best prices however they want. Often times for you all faster than anybody else out there, which you guys can do a great job of that.

- Unknown (4/30/25 1:07 PM): that, that's how we take care of our customers. The trust is really important as well. I think about trust in two ways. One is more around the reputational trust and the other is the loyalty. What I mean by reputation is again, we're taking care of the customers through some price experience. Customers also want to make sure that we are taking care of our associates, taking care of our communities as well. When we do those things, that's how we improve the reputation of our customers. And in return, we should be seeing the loyalty from our customers coming showing up in the ways of them coming back completely great or them shopping across all the different categories over and over again.

- Unknown (4/30/25 1:08 PM): So again, so that to me then is the sortment price experience and trust to me is that will leads to us can be able to win first place wallet share.

- Unknown (4/30/25 1:08 PM): That makes sense so far. Thing is, it's expensive. It's expensive getting having all the assortment that customers want at really fast speed and at the very best prices. And we also have a commitment to our investors to be able to deliver profits to them as well. And so that's where need the business enablers or accelerators are coming to play. And I keep it up grouping those into two buckets. First three is about alternative revenue streams, which is going to give us a profit pool to be able to deliver investment. And then the fourth one automation to me is a bit of a catch all for improving our business model or improving our profitability as well.

- Unknown (4/30/25 1:09 PM): So the first one around is alternative revenue streams. Walmart Plus memberships and XL state ventures, they're not the only big things that we have going for us. Those are the big ones in terms of alternative revenue streams. Um Walmart Plus, I will say, so I came from Walmart Plus, this is something I care very deeply about. Walmart Plus as a program is intended to be a sales growth catalyst. Thing is, as you all very much know,

- Unknown (4/30/25 1:09 PM): process such stuff so that we can continue to reinvest back into delivery and into our CVP as a whole. Same with state ventures. That's really going to help to accelerate and help improve profitability of our e-commerce stuff. And finally when it comes to automation, that's all about how do we start to reduce the tasks, the number of tasks that our associates have to do and or increase the efficiency of that so that we can continue to do more and more things at a lower cost.

- Unknown (4/30/25 1:10 PM): That's so far. Great. So diving a little bit more into the CVP of what we're trying to accomplish this year.

- Unknown (4/30/25 1:10 PM): assortment. I think about assortment in two broad buckets. Our first party assortment and our marketplace assortment, our third party assortment. On the first party side of things, right, it's all about the depth of assortment. We want to have all the items that our customers really want the most and we want it first party because we can control the price, we can control the experience. And you can't do that very simply. Therefore that's where the marketplace comes in, right? which is getting our getting our customer sort of breadth of items that they want. It's not just the things they want the most, but the things that they trust to come to our site and get.

- Unknown (4/30/25 1:11 PM): whatever it is that you want. you can serve that way you can get on the site.

- Unknown (4/30/25 1:11 PM): Honestly though, it's not getting up just to have the items.

- Unknown (4/30/25 1:11 PM): We got to make sure that those items down from our site or our app or wherever it might be, that it is displaying in a way that is appealing to our customers and that makes them want to buy those things.

- Unknown (4/30/25 1:11 PM): And then I would say that last bullet around the priority brands, that is an initiative.

- Unknown (4/30/25 1:11 PM): Most of those by the way, so for sure, but I identify what those key brands are that we don't have right now, and get those things as well.

- Unknown (4/30/25 1:11 PM): Price, again, you can think about it kind of in the one repeat basket or a segment less because of the weight of.

- Unknown (4/30/25 1:12 PM): From a one perspective, very simply put, we want to be the price leader.

- Unknown (4/30/25 1:12 PM): That doesn't mean that we're going to be the lowest price on every single item out there, but we want to have a customer perception of being the price leader.

- Unknown (4/30/25 1:12 PM): We talked about basket versus segment before.

- Unknown (4/30/25 1:12 PM): damages one to have very less.

- Unknown (4/30/25 1:12 PM): Obviously on the marketplace side it becomes a little bit more difficult because we don't control prices.

- Unknown (4/30/25 1:12 PM): But there are things that we can do to try and improve that, right? To work with our existing sellers, not providing incentives or providing them with signals to be more competitive.

- Unknown (4/30/25 1:12 PM): We can also think about finding the right sellers who will offer those items at the competitive pricing that we want.

- Unknown (4/30/25 1:12 PM): And so it's really incumbent on us on finding that right balance in order to make our marketplace appealing to customers.

- Unknown (4/30/25 1:12 PM): Um and then experience. I like to think about experience as having three key things here.

- Unknown (4/30/25 1:12 PM): The first two are related to e-commerce and that's what is. The third buying store is what the best people for.

- Unknown (4/30/25 1:13 PM): So the first one here should be near and dear to all of us here. And that is all about fast delivery or our scheduled delivery.

- Unknown (4/30/25 1:13 PM): I love you all get to hear this, but Rebecca gets an update every morning or every Monday morning about fast delivery availability.

- Unknown (4/30/25 1:13 PM): And it's usually the shortest update of the week because she says, we're 95% close, we're good.

- Unknown (4/30/25 1:13 PM): Thank you.

- Unknown (4/30/25 1:13 PM): No, but that wasn't the narrative. That wasn't the kinds of conversations we were having at the end of last year to the beginning of this year.

- Unknown (4/30/25 1:13 PM): For that to flip that so quickly is pretty amazing. I mean it's at the point now where you know it's almost kind of a given.

- Unknown (4/30/25 1:13 PM): And I will say as well, we're working on some um the upcoming board of directors meeting. talking about delivery and that's a key part of that.

- Unknown (4/30/25 1:14 PM): We're talking to the board and the board understands, hey, fast delivery, that's our success. We want to know so are you worried about or are we focused on the availability of the execution.

- Unknown (4/30/25 1:14 PM): And it's nice to be able to write and say, availability is really important. That's something he's trying to check and said, we can check that off basically because we feel really good about it.

- Unknown (4/30/25 1:14 PM): Now, I know there's a lot that's still being done. a lot of dumping, a lot of manual work. So there are ways to automate this and make it more sustainable.

- Unknown (4/30/25 1:14 PM): But we're able to create that perception.

- Unknown (4/30/25 1:14 PM): But hey, great job.

- Unknown (4/30/25 1:14 PM): Fast delivery, and today we want to expand both our coverage and our availability.

- Unknown (4/30/25 1:14 PM): And we want to be able to get as many items that our customers want to them as fast as we can.

- Unknown (4/30/25 1:14 PM): On the next day side of things there, the rallying cry is that we start to get more and more certain to build for our customers. And what we're trying to accomplish this year, it's a bit of a stretch goal but definitely what we want to push for is that for 75% of our households in this country, we want to make 1 million items or more available to next day.

- Unknown (4/30/25 1:15 PM): I say it in that order as opposed to saying 1 million items available next day to 75% of households because it's not the same 1 million items that we're trying to get to 75.

- Unknown (4/30/25 1:15 PM): What we want to say is for every single customer out there, how do we get million items that we think are going to be most relevant. And ensuring that hey, we got to identify what those items are. We got to place them correctly so it can even get to them next day and then we got

- Unknown (4/30/25 1:15 PM): That's the name of the game on the next day side of things.

- Unknown (4/30/25 1:15 PM): Like I said, those are the two things that we are focused on from an e-commerce standpoint that we think are going to give us a lot.

- Unknown (4/30/25 1:15 PM): and win with our customers.

- Unknown (4/30/25 1:15 PM): The third in terms of buying stores though,

- Unknown (4/30/25 1:16 PM): with us right now, the in store sales which drives those often what is able to allow us to invest in the other place.

- Unknown (4/30/25 1:16 PM): So we got to preserve the buying store sales while growing. It's not an easy task but I get that.

- Unknown (4/30/25 1:16 PM): that's also really important.

- Unknown (4/30/25 1:16 PM): Great.

- Unknown (4/30/25 1:16 PM): Finally from a trust standpoint, we focus here more on that reputational trust about how do we take care of our associates, how do we take care of our communities.

- Unknown (4/30/25 1:16 PM): And I know just from my team, the areas that I've been in, I'm sure it's the same up here is that we spend so much time

- Unknown (4/30/25 1:16 PM): that's also really important because we here are the ones that are able to remember our customers. we also need to be thinking about investing in our associates, not just necessarily from wages and compensation, which should also be important.

- Unknown (4/30/25 1:16 PM): also creating the training, the tools and the opportunities to grow. So, I'll leave you all with that um just as a reminder that we need to taking care of each other and thank you for everything.

- Unknown (4/30/25 1:17 PM): I want to quickly so I had a chance to work with Burton.

- Unknown (4/30/25 1:17 PM): Sorry, I just want to for everybody.

- Unknown (4/30/25 1:17 PM): Um so I had a chance to work with Burton when I was in finance. So most of you guys know I previously was in finance before um moving over here. And so what I would just want to everyone to kind of recognize is a year ago, when we were having conversations around strategy and goals and priorities, it was really hard to crystallize exactly what things meant. And like when we talked about our strategy and our like, what do we mean when we want to be faster or like what's this mean? And I just want to like recognize Burton in front of a little people that he has done like a fabulous job of actually giving helping the organization get crystal clear on what the priorities are this year, right? Which is we know we got to grow faster.

- Unknown (4/30/25 1:18 PM): There are metrics that go with each of these that you see on the screen. And we also to his point, we talk about them every Monday when we come together as a leadership team across the organization. And a year ago that wasn't the case. So we're kind of all working towards it's almost like you know when you're like kind of in the dark and trying to figure your way and you know you're going this way but you really don't know who's all around you. I'd say like we have more light now that we actually can see who's next to us, we're holding hands and we're moving together and it was because we really got to.

- Unknown (4/30/25 1:18 PM): So I just want to thank you for and the other people that he's been really.

- Unknown (4/30/25 1:18 PM): All right.

- Unknown (4/30/25 1:18 PM): I will say though if any of you do have questions or to talk about anything right feedback, please reach out. I am more than happy to chat and to solicit great ideas from you. So thank you.

- Unknown (4/30/25 1:19 PM): I'm going to rely on you guys to look at and be not shy to play strategic role in Walmart. I think if we do ever have a big Walmart US strategy, I think this is the year we have the most influence to get. And then we're pointing everything. Some we have your planning the retail point, some we have other place, some we're helping other team get there. I think this is the year where almost everything in the total company Walmart US strategy, you have some role to play in each and every part. Whether it's people side, trust side, team side, every part. Somebody on the team. So I think it's good to actually I think when we started off, we used to see the Walmart US strategy like we'll see 10 slides like that we know mentioned last time like you know. And I think now we're going we come from there to like a big part of like a core strategy company that will be well received which is great for the story.

- Unknown (4/30/25 1:20 PM): So maybe what we would do is like we're going to over the next probably like I was told once um when I was earlier in my career, the best way to make a meeting go fast is to get people scared.

- Unknown (4/30/25 1:20 PM): That was not the intention today. Um, we will get a bigger room. I think our option was either a smaller room or we would have to like delay it for another month and I did not want to delay another month until getting us together. So but we will get a bigger room so people aren't on the floor.

- Unknown (4/30/25 1:20 PM): We'll get a bigger room. Um, but we'll also in the next little bit. So Burton started with US segment, right? I'm going to hit really high level what we call like the end to end strategy, right? And then we'll get into the last mile and then we'll kind of go through how we're going to organize ourselves going forward and so that'll be kind of the next step. You can kind of think of it as like, you know, starting big and then just continuing to go back down.

- Unknown (4/30/25 1:21 PM): Maybe I'll start with how many people in the room have only been here for say less than a year. Raise your hand if less than a year. Yeah. I figured because.

- Unknown (4/30/25 1:21 PM): So maybe I'll first start with end to end. So I was like and it's okay to not know this or some of you not really sure what we when we say end to end what that means. Does even everyone know what that means when I say end to end?

- Unknown (4/30/25 1:21 PM): I don't know.

- Unknown (4/30/25 1:21 PM): Okay, thank you for being. So because it's still fairly new. So end to end is I think it's only what three years old? Three or four years old.

- Unknown (4/30/25 1:21 PM): 22.

- Unknown (4/30/25 1:21 PM): Right, I can always count on you.

- Unknown (4/30/25 1:21 PM): still work out promoted. And um.

- Unknown (4/30/25 1:21 PM): Yeah, because when the team put on all that happened during. Got it. All right, so 22. So that would be even three years. Yeah, so we're three years. So end to end, if you think about it, it's really the the way I kind of explain it is it's that operational unit, right of Walmart. So starting from transportation of how we basically get all the products from, you know, either domestically or internationally through to our supply chain, so all of our DCs, right? To the stores.

- Unknown (4/30/25 1:22 PM): So all of the store operation to the real estate team that makes sure we have those facilities, right? And we're making it operate to the last mile team that gets to deliver it. So it's really the operational units of Walmart. And we have support teams that obviously are part of that as well. But that's the way when you think about end to end, think about it as like really the operational units of this business that are interacting with last mile and everything else. Okay? So this is here in what we would call here in the end to end strategy and I'll I'll hit really high level just this what it is and then we'll keep diving what it means for last mile. But in the basic form, we know we got to win first place wallet share, right? For end to end. That's really kind of the priority that we have as an organization. And the way the end to end leadership team kind of thinks about it is like we're the ones that get to bring Walmart to life, right? So if you think about all those things that I just said, like we like if you think about what a customer experiences either at a store or at their doorstep, it's really the end to end team that brings Walmart to life. And so when we as a leadership team talk about it, that's kind of like that customer obsessed focus that we think about. And then underneath of that is we kind of said, okay, to bring Walmart to life, there are going to be three things across end to end that are going to be priorities, right? So first priority is being the best place to work and shop, right? And that it's a everything from when you walk into our stores to how you have it delivered to the supply chain associates, right? How do we make sure that the facilities that we operate in, the uh is top class and is best in class. And then how do you make sure that the experience that the customers have is the way. So if you think about that from a goal's perspective, real estate, how they're making sure we're doing a lot of remodels as an organization and keeping up with our facilities to how the stores interact with our customers to how we deliver, right? On time in full to the customer. So that's very much around like be the best place to shop. The second big priority is enable growth through transformation. We are spending a lot of money as an organization right now specifically within end to end. We're spending it very much on the physical side. So if you hear about automation in our in our DCs and our stores, we're spending a lot of capital, right? But it's really going in to automate those facilities and that the the ROI from that is because we can get more through those facilities. So how do we continue to grow those facilities, right? So all around how do we create these investments to be a growth generator. Okay? And then the final thing is people, right? We know that it takes I think we're at like some point when we added it up like 1.6 million people uh billion billion. Yeah. Operating in these events. Um it's a lot. Um but anyway, so to make all of this come to life. And so we talk a lot as a leadership team of do we have the tools and skills? There's a lot in the market right now and how many of you guys heard about AI and ML and what agents are going to do? Like raise your hand if you've heard anything in the last like month about it, right? Like our job is to make sure that everyone in this room and everyone in rooms around this home office and in our stores are enabled with those tools to make it easier to do the job, right? And so like that is where we think about when we think about reinvestment is how do we make sure that we all are the ones that are like kind of working with that and making the jobs even more efficient. So that's kind of the overarching if you think about strategy and priorities. And where it come down to is there's three broad buckets, but you're probably starting to see it come up in our end to end town halls, which is all about service, right? Are we giving the customer what they want?

- Unknown (4/30/25 1:26 PM): Speed, which is kind of a newer one that's come up in this last year and a lot of it is because of the work and what you guys have proven can do is like you need to get something fast.

- Unknown (4/30/25 1:26 PM): The customer's liking it, right? When we can speed up how we do deliveries from our supply chain to the stores, we need less inventory because we can we don't have to hold it so much in other places.

- Unknown (4/30/25 1:26 PM): So speed is going to be a huge priority for this organization.

- Unknown (4/30/25 1:26 PM): And then obviously the skills on how we keep building it. So when we think about end to end, this is kind of that strategy and that overarching priorities that Karen has set out for all of us to say, as we build towards our CBP and we think about each of us as individuals, these are kind of the lenses and the priorities that we got to keep in front of us.

- Unknown (4/30/25 1:27 PM): I'll take a minute because like we hit US strategy, end to end strategy and then we're going to turn and go into last mile. Before I get into maybe our space, any questions?

- Unknown (4/30/25 1:27 PM): CVP.

- Unknown (4/30/25 1:27 PM): CVP. What is CVP? Customer value proposition.

- Unknown (4/30/25 1:27 PM): It's a really good question. because if you're in the stores, it's also the yellow, right? If you get like going to your meat and you want to get $2 off, it's also probably CVP.

- Unknown (4/30/25 1:27 PM): Um, so customer value prop. Like what is the the proposition that we want to be able to offer our customer? That's why you got like price savings.

- Unknown (4/30/25 1:27 PM): is all way off. Um, those but I don't know. Oh, that's from before, yeah. That's from before. Gosh, who's who's running the that when they were saying that they are they're leaving.

- Unknown (4/30/25 1:28 PM): Oh, okay.

- Unknown (4/30/25 1:28 PM): But I said if anyone has questions, feel free to put it on the chat.

- Unknown (4/30/25 1:28 PM): Yeah, put it on the chat as we go through and we'll uh we'll if we don't get a chance to answer it here, we'll definitely go back and answer it and put it in the.

- Unknown (4/30/25 1:28 PM): All right. So, let's dig into last mile. And maybe before we go into like the specifics of our strategy, I was um I I was doing quite a bit of reflecting, especially over I would say the last 12 or 24 hours. Um because yesterday I had the opportunity. Did anyone go to the sustainability summit yesterday?

- Unknown (4/30/25 1:28 PM): Yeah. Um, we celebrated 20 years from the time that Lee Scott kind of came out and he gave what was what now is basically one of the most important and famous speeches that Walmart has done, which is basically committing to some really big

- Unknown (4/30/25 1:28 PM): we were going to think about sustainability as a business. So like no waste, right? I think that's like by 2040 and it was like we were going to have like reduce our emissions, all these big things. And as I was sitting there, so Lee Scott, who was our CEO at the time, um, if you ever get a chance to hear him, like his humor,

- Unknown (4/30/25 1:29 PM): I mean, it's funny. Um, but I was like sitting there and I was I was reflecting on 18 years ago when I found myself in a Walmart onboarding. So I we were at the time we actually used to do like four or five days when you first joined the company. Like my guess is those who have joined in the last is like what half day, right?

- Unknown (4/30/25 1:29 PM): Well, I figure that out. But four days was probably too long. But we were sitting there and I just remember, you know, I was like had just come out of college and I was learning about the company, right? We were in the middle of a recession, right? We're in the middle of a recession and I had just joined this company and they spent all this time talking about how we were going to do good things for the planet, right?

- Unknown (4/30/25 1:30 PM): And I had that moment like as I was thinking yesterday as everything that was going on in the world like back then, it was like this sign of hope, right? And like really like excitement that was happening. And so now I fast forward, right? And getting to talk about last mile delivery, right? With the company, we're in a strange time, right? As well from a macro and everything environment.

- Unknown (4/30/25 1:30 PM): But I'm so excited about like what this company and what we are saying we're going to want to continue to do. So if I think about the sustainability, like we're not backing off. And we're going to continue to invest and we're figuring out how we make the lives of our customers better.

- Unknown (4/30/25 1:30 PM): So, I say all that to say as we get into the last mile, like there's just so much good and it's so exciting like the things that we're going to talk about that we're doing and it just continues to give me hope as even somebody who's been here for 18 years that we are just getting started. Like I say that like we are literally probably let's 55, 60 years old the company. I shouldn't know that and I don't. Um, but we still are so young if you really think about the cool things that we have ahead of us, what are what the company is investing in and what this team is doing. So, I thought I'd share that because I was having that reflective moment last night and I was thinking about my day and thinking about the big goals.

- Unknown (4/30/25 1:31 PM): Okay. So, last mile delivery. Um so I stole a line and this is what how we bring Walmart to life, right? Within last mile delivery. And so what you'll see is our key priority is still the same as the total segment, right? Our job is to win first place from wallet share and how do we support that?

- Unknown (4/30/25 1:31 PM): Underneath that, we know how to win making that customer value prop or CVP, I really like to say. Um, and the two areas where we play. We play them all as now mentioned, but the two if you really think about where we are really focused is on the experience and trust side of that customer value prop. So really focusing on that and then how we handle how we are still focused on speed and skills.

- Unknown (4/30/25 1:32 PM): So when we thought about our priorities, the five priorities on the bottom are where we're going to spend time this year, probably next year continuing to focus on, right? So the first one, Spark digital acceleration, trust and safety, right? As as a as a team, how stable the platform is, how safe it is, how all the things to make sure that we're taking care of the customer, the store and creating a better experience for that driver is really important, right? That that is like kind of the base.

- Unknown (4/30/25 1:32 PM): and making sure we do the right thing every day across the platform.

- Unknown (4/30/25 1:32 PM): Fast delivery, we'll go into the details of that, but it's part of the CVP, it's one of the biggest growth areas of the company.

- Unknown (4/30/25 1:32 PM): When a customer does a fast delivery order four times or more.

- Unknown (4/30/25 1:33 PM): You guys all heard this one, metric, not like let's move right into it, because it's a great one.

- Unknown (4/30/25 1:33 PM): Four times or more, they will spend over 10% a month across the whole Walmart platform.

- Unknown (4/30/25 1:33 PM): They come back more often, they spend more, they trust us.

- Unknown (4/30/25 1:33 PM): They give us a lot of shit.

- Unknown (4/30/25 1:33 PM): So that is why it is so critical, it is such a good offering and it really makes what the customer needs.

- Unknown (4/30/25 1:33 PM): Customer and driver experience, we'll talk a little bit about why we combine this, because I think that's probably maybe a different thing right now, but we know that we have to provide the right customer and driver experience.

- Unknown (4/30/25 1:33 PM): on it.

- Unknown (4/30/25 1:33 PM): Um, optimization, when I think about optimization,

- Unknown (4/30/25 1:33 PM): and I don't necessarily think just specifically about like cost reduction, which might have been the thought before, when I think about optimization, I think about how do we best leverage the driver supply in the best way possible, right?

- Unknown (4/30/25 1:33 PM): So we can make sure that we're creating the right environment and we're giving an optimized experience, which will improve both the driver experience and customer experience.

- Unknown (4/30/25 1:34 PM): So then the bunch kind of go again that way.

- Unknown (4/30/25 1:34 PM): And the last one is how do we re-invest in all of you, right?

- Unknown (4/30/25 1:34 PM): So we're looking at things that we're going to focus on this next year and how we want to invest in this group.

- Unknown (4/30/25 1:34 PM): Um, as you know.

- Unknown (4/30/25 1:34 PM): So that's kind of the priorities that we're focused on.

- Unknown (4/30/25 1:34 PM): If you click to the next page, this kind of breaks down and it's a lot on a slide, we'll send it out, so you don't feel like you have to like memorize it.

- Unknown (4/30/25 1:34 PM): Um, but this is really just been breaking it down into a little bit of the things I said and how we're going to start to think about how we model right against it and where do we number and how do we focus and what are going to be some of the key initiatives over time that fall into these buckets.

- Unknown (4/30/25 1:34 PM): So I kind of hit all of them, but I won't because you're all spending and I'm not going to go and say it all again.

- Unknown (4/30/25 1:34 PM): Um, but I do want to hit this middle one.

- Unknown (4/30/25 1:34 PM): And so one of the things as we kind of thought about it was it's how important for that customer and driver experience to be so interconnected, right?

- Unknown (4/30/25 1:34 PM): Because we know that if the driver has a good experience, either doing the shopping in the back of the store, driving and finding the right location to get to the customer's house, ultimately, the customer.

- Unknown (4/30/25 1:35 PM): So how do we think about that together where it's not just we want to provide just the customer a good experience.

- Unknown (4/30/25 1:35 PM): Because if you only focus on that, we can sub optimize a lot for that driver and the driver is really a bit of the um what can I use for the day?

- Unknown (4/30/25 1:35 PM): I always mess up the word, but basically it it came on behalf of the customer, right?

- Unknown (4/30/25 1:35 PM): And so we know if the driver has a good experience, the chances are it's going to be a good experience for the customer as well.

- Unknown (4/30/25 1:35 PM): So we'll we'll start to think about those kind of together.

- Unknown (4/30/25 1:35 PM): Thoughts.

- Unknown (4/30/25 1:35 PM): project, so it's not over.

- Unknown (4/30/25 1:35 PM): Um, how how how are we thinking about the differentiation between service and customer experience?

- Unknown (4/30/25 1:35 PM): So it's not very different because normally plus

- Unknown (4/30/25 1:36 PM): right? And it's the Walmart plus 5 billion and then you got

- Unknown (4/30/25 1:36 PM): How do we optimize more versus you're saying that experience is behind you.

- Unknown (4/30/25 1:36 PM): That's a great, I haven't really thought about that to be fair about the differentiation.

- Unknown (4/30/25 1:36 PM): So I kind of think about it as when you have the W plus, one, they are they paid, right?

- Unknown (4/30/25 1:36 PM): They pay money to be a member of Walmart and all our services, so we should give them really great service.

- Unknown (4/30/25 1:36 PM): Um, if they're not a member and we give them really good service, we hope that it will get them to convert to W plus member.

- Unknown (4/30/25 1:36 PM): So I kind of think about it as how do we just make sure we're continuing to service like the baseline of like what we would expect is good across the board, right?

- Unknown (4/30/25 1:36 PM): And then when you have the you have a really good baseline, I can kind of imagine maybe a year or two from now, we can maybe start to differentiate it, right?

- Unknown (4/30/25 1:36 PM): And and say is there something more we can do for those W plus member, so then get others to convert.

- Unknown (4/30/25 1:37 PM): But right now I think about like just making sure we we offer that experience well.

- Unknown (4/30/25 1:37 PM): Does that help? It's a great question.

- Unknown (4/30/25 1:37 PM): I think generally in like keep going back to the that we keep more sales, we get a better experience.

- Unknown (4/30/25 1:37 PM): I think that thing goes there there's also a big point that every member is one month at a time.

- Unknown (4/30/25 1:37 PM): And I think ensuring that we also give a good non member experience there is the to get the pipeline of the business.

- Unknown (4/30/25 1:37 PM): So I think we just need to like play a like a balanced score between like how do we make sure everyone gets.

- Unknown (4/30/25 1:37 PM): But then there are just some things that are that genuinely seems like they're not like a negative versus a positive, it's a positive plus an extra positive.

- Unknown (4/30/25 1:37 PM): Let's be compared and going into that.

- Unknown (4/30/25 1:37 PM): That's what I thought.

- Unknown (4/30/25 1:37 PM): Hey, Rebecca, I have another question.

- Unknown (4/30/25 1:37 PM): Um, when we think of, yeah, when we think of optimization, um, have we thought of like other services that we could get drivers to provide, right?

- Unknown (4/30/25 1:38 PM): Like something that's closely related is maybe expanding returns not just for Walmart, but like other retailers, like if we do go local where we serve other retailers, then if we did returns to them, that could be an expansion, but yeah, that there's probably lots of other ways.

- Unknown (4/30/25 1:38 PM): Would that be something you would do in the near future or is the core business growing too fast and we need to support that?

- Unknown (4/30/25 1:38 PM): That.

- Unknown (4/30/25 1:38 PM): I see a world in the very near future where the word change over time, but where we start to think about chaining our orders, it's going to be there.

- Unknown (4/30/25 1:38 PM): So if you think about some of our competitors, right? I'll just use um I'll use Go Puff, right? And how they do it.

- Unknown (4/30/25 1:38 PM): Like they right now have um where they deliver Starbucks, right?

- Unknown (4/30/25 1:38 PM): And so you can basically place your Starbucks order, you don't have to do it through like any others and you can get for trees at the same time.

- Unknown (4/30/25 1:39 PM): And they basically created that experience where you can do from another company and their company.

- Unknown (4/30/25 1:39 PM): So, yes, I imagine a world where that is going to not it's going to be something that um our customers expect and what they want.

- Unknown (4/30/25 1:39 PM): And I think what we've got to be thoughtful of and it's a really good point is how do we make sure every decision we make when we start to build um products and capabilities has the ability to be flexible enough to start to think about those things.

- Unknown (4/30/25 1:39 PM): Um, because I do think that's going to be a space in the future where we'll have to we'll get I don't think we'll have to, we'll get the opportunity to play.

- Unknown (4/30/25 1:39 PM): I'm agreeable, we're all these things that we're like I said, you want to think about

- Unknown (4/30/25 1:39 PM): marketplace and drivers, deliveries is our biggest thing here, that's the only thing we right now but if you think about it from a very long term perspective, we're building a marketplace of vendors who are powering the people

- Unknown (4/30/25 1:40 PM): that develop most quickly than anything else and you know if there's really moments that we need to like deliver and do other things and other things.

- Unknown (4/30/25 1:40 PM): I think every single item the team has done about the other was the same like doing the terms for any retailer that's a project going on, you know team was saying that

- Unknown (4/30/25 1:40 PM): that I mean different types.

- Unknown (4/30/25 1:40 PM): last launch deliveries and the team has worked on multiple ideas to figure out which year, what do we focus on?

- Unknown (4/30/25 1:40 PM): How much effort we put on it and just do things at the right time.

- Unknown (4/30/25 1:40 PM): I think but in the long run everything will happen.

- Unknown (4/30/25 1:40 PM): really. I mean I think maybe just to to do that. So if I go back to why I'm super excited about this space, right? is delivery and all is one, I'm a mom and a customer and so I get how awesome the service is and you can also see our customers are super excited about it.

- Unknown (4/30/25 1:40 PM): percent.

- Unknown (4/30/25 1:40 PM): already, which is huge. So we've got that, right?

- Unknown (4/30/25 1:41 PM): I think the second

- Unknown (4/30/25 1:41 PM): is I think it was the Easter weekend, we had more drivers on the platform than we've ever had, right?

- Unknown (4/30/25 1:41 PM): And so there are more drivers out there that are choosing to come on this platform than we've ever had.

- Unknown (4/30/25 1:41 PM): And then third, raise your hand if you think there you have an idea that could either make the platform better or grow the platform.

- Unknown (4/30/25 1:41 PM): Raise it.

- Unknown (4/30/25 1:41 PM): This is a winning combination.

- Unknown (4/30/25 1:41 PM): Right? We got the why, we got the men, and we got lots of ideas.

- Unknown (4/30/25 1:41 PM): Like this is going to be where it's going to be super exciting is because there's so much more we can do, right?

- Unknown (4/30/25 1:41 PM): So yeah, right.

- Unknown (4/30/25 1:41 PM): All the ideas. I love it.

- Unknown (4/30/25 1:41 PM): I do want to think about on that one though is and and really kind of turn into then how do I see us now like structuring ourselves to go and and engage, right?

- Unknown (4/30/25 1:42 PM): So, and Josh and Maria, if you guys can come up to the front as well for me.

- Unknown (4/30/25 1:42 PM): So you're like, okay, so hopefully by by now and if not, like you guys have kind of seen or heard a little bit about some of the changes that we want to do as a group.

- Unknown (4/30/25 1:42 PM): And so as the business um by default and all the scale that's already happened, we know we've got a lot more to scale.

- Unknown (4/30/25 1:42 PM): And so as we started to think about how we wanted to structure our team, like how do we want to structure ourselves so we can really scale this in a really thoughtful way.

- Unknown (4/30/25 1:42 PM): the best way I can think about it is we're going to organize organize ourselves based on really clear capabilities, right? The capabilities that we know we need to really go drive forward.

- Unknown (4/30/25 1:42 PM): And so we kind of put together a new structure really that's focused on what I would call vertical capability accountability, right? Which is what we'll call it a driver platform and trip operation side.

- Unknown (4/30/25 1:42 PM): And then that one is on a collaboration where it's like really that those groups that have to run across all of the all the things that drive this business to make sure we're able to scale, right?

- Unknown (4/30/25 1:43 PM): Because it's all around scaling and how do we do this in a way that's going to give us kind of the ability to scale.

- Unknown (4/30/25 1:43 PM): So as you heard, we kind of put this together. So this is um Has anyone seen this yet, maybe?

- Unknown (4/30/25 1:43 PM): No. Oh new. Oh. Perfect. I'm so new.

- Unknown (4/30/25 1:43 PM): Oh, I love it.

- Unknown (4/30/25 1:43 PM): Um, don't get again, don't get the slides, don't feel like you have to take a picture or anything, but this is the way we're going to structure ourselves.

- Unknown (4/30/25 1:43 PM): I'll let each kind of team and so Sarah, I'll I'll try to talk on behalf of Sarah since she's on vacation and we want her to stay on vacation.

- Unknown (4/30/25 1:43 PM): But now, do you want to talk a little bit about kind of how you're thinking about your team?

- Unknown (4/30/25 1:43 PM): Yeah, like few things one a lot of the bullet points you can see maybe teams but I think some of the words still continues to be the same work or everyone being focused on.

- Unknown (4/30/25 1:44 PM): When you think of platform operations, I would just say I think we've been doing it, but we'll try to like leap frog a little bit more and try to think about this as a central platform.

- Unknown (4/30/25 1:44 PM): Like we're not operating our drivers are operating in our underground business, we're not operating any underground office.

- Unknown (4/30/25 1:44 PM): So we need to build anything and everything in a very scalable way.

- Unknown (4/30/25 1:44 PM): When you think of supply performance, you need to put the right tools, technology frameworks to have the right supply automatically.

- Unknown (4/30/25 1:44 PM): doesn't need any intervention.

- Unknown (4/30/25 1:44 PM): You need to have the right like trip planning and route optimization capabilities that us again run things in a very technology focused way.

- Unknown (4/30/25 1:44 PM): Like we can't go and take decisions on like this order should go to this store, this order should be routed here.

- Unknown (4/30/25 1:44 PM): Everything needs to be run in a very technology driven uh way overall.

- Unknown (4/30/25 1:44 PM): Uh, people and all. DSP operations and van delivery, we've now brought all together. Now the driver platform team is till now it'd be spark drivers, but now it's we just think about the experience of our 1099 contract vans also together. We have associates going in from deliveries. Now we're trying to think about all of our van delivery operations also together along with this. And at the end we wrap it up on the platform office with all the driver capabilities with the things to this a lot over capabilities and how we price or we search, how do we match. But again, it could be built in a very, very technology oriented way and with a lot more focus on how do we automate. I think we're still building a lot more siloed ML models, AI models that are doing their job and doing it pretty well. I think we're now going into the work of like how do we have all of these models talk to each other and actually think in in sync rather than like thinking independently. Like how do we ensure supply knows in the same way, knows what incentives is already done.

- Unknown (4/30/25 1:45 PM): knows what's happening with the mind, knows what's happening with the number of orders online and they all start to come together in an automated way. And like at the end right the areas we have on driver experience, I mean this is now focused on how do we think about across the board for all of our drivers, like do they have the right experience? Are they getting the right rewards for being on the platform in the right tiers? Are they having the right experience with no defects possible? Are they engaging with us in the right way? And then how do we like hear and listen to our drivers in the right way? All of this eventually to like get the right satisfaction, retention and defects at the right level for our drivers. Um, I think the main thing for me is like how do we lead from into building these um a lot more automation and a lot more tools that we can use. Um, there's a lot we are doing and we need to continue doing that where we're just thinking just let's just put like five people can come together and solve this problem and run this. I think more and more now I'm trying to think about how do we really build this so this platform can run for hundreds of thousands of drivers all at once in the same way.

- Unknown (4/30/25 1:46 PM): trip. Yeah, so that'll be in trip operation. So we are going to build out what we'll call as part of our trip operations, a defects team. So we're we still are working through getting that leadership in place. And so when we finalize that, we'll come back. But think about that as kind of the the team that's really kind of intaking all the the feedback either we're getting from the field or the data is telling us and then making sure it's getting into the right capability owners to go solve, right? So how do we make sure as we scale this that we still are managing the things that maybe aren't great, right? But we know we're going to have to go back and fix. And so we're going to be building out kind of the the defects team in a more centralized way. And so once we get that leader in place, we'll come back and share kind of what that structure and all the details for that one.

- Unknown (4/30/25 1:47 PM): Sure. Uh, many of you might not know, I'm Josh Osman. I'm the guy who thought was only here for a year. I've been here longer than that. So, um, I have been mostly working on the store operations uh side of the house uh for about 12 years. Um, and I've led checkout. I've led associate tools, really uh making it easier to get in stock, to get the item from the back room out to the out to the shelf and located. Um, and so I've been doing a lot of that um over the years and more recently, it's been a real mind shift of going, okay, we have this like this new cool technology that we're going to use for our associates. And then it's always like, well, how do we enable spark shopper for it, whether it's digital locks or whether it's M GPS, all of these projects that my team has worked on. Um, and also, um, how do you enable our own shoppers uh to take advantage of these like really, really amazing things that we're transforming retail with.

- Unknown (4/30/25 1:48 PM): And so, um, I've always been in awe of what you all do. Um, and more recently I've been like, oh, I I this is important part of our business. Like we're all on the same team. And I think that if you look at like the spark shopper vertical, that's all we're trying to do is put the associate and the spark shopper on the same team. You've all probably heard 1 plus 1 equals 3. Like that's the idea. We take uh an amazing part of our business, really core part of our business, which is our store associate and then match them to the shopper and go like, how can we share? How can we make sure that we're all playing on the same team and doing the same things? Um, with the technology and with the uh transformations that we have. So it's easier to, you know, put something in a locking case and we're giving the ability to unlock. We'll think about that for uh our personal shopper and our spark shopper at the same time. And so, uh we're looking at this in in uh a few different verticals. One is picking, so in optimization, how do we just make it easier um to go to the store, to put the to be there. Um, and then route them in the most optimized way. And then also in picking really what's that customer experience? What is that when I go to the store, um, and I typically do the shopping in the house and uh my wife gives me a list and something's not there. Like it's always an easy text of like what do you what else do you want? What else can I do? Like how can we make it really easy and natural um in in in their own language too. Like these are the things that we're doing.

- Unknown (4/30/25 1:50 PM): Um, the uh checkout uh is the other the way I I think about checkout is really just it's trust. It's like associate and um and spark shopper like having a mutual understanding, trust so that there's less friction or to no friction in the store. They get in, they get out easy. We have the right controls in place, everything's good. Um, and then expansion. So how do we grow our GMV? How do we continue to grow and add these to the basket and anticipate

- Unknown (4/30/25 1:50 PM): things are coming up by season. And uh planning really is just all around keeping us as the team on track and understanding what.

- Unknown (4/30/25 1:51 PM): Yeah.

- Unknown (4/30/25 1:51 PM): Um, I'll hit Sarah's real quick because she's out right now on PTO. So I think actually quite a few people in this room probably are on this team. Um, so as we thought about trust and safety, we announced in January obviously that we were going to put a team together. Um, and as she's come in, really thinking about how we want to structure as well, um, the trust and safety team.

- Unknown (4/30/25 1:51 PM): And so the way that um kind of over the next couple months we'll think about it is we know we've got incident management, right? The things with like how do we make sure that as things come in, we can quickly resolve and and have all the right people involved in that to get to resolution.

- Unknown (4/30/25 1:51 PM): And then there is um the safety side. think about how do we ensure that again that real safe mindset that we're putting in embedded into the office. How do we make sure we continue to focus on that? That's part of like getting a really good experience both for the drivers.

- Unknown (4/30/25 1:52 PM): Fraud and digital identity, Shane's here. Um, and so how do we just continue to make sure we're focused on that, right? Um, that is probably been one of the biggest learnings that I've had as I've joined the team is every week there's something new out there um that people are coming up with. Um, and so how do we just stay on top of that and make sure we're continuing to deliver models and our processes.

- Unknown (4/30/25 1:52 PM): Um, compliance and governance. Um, so we are bringing together the compliance and governance groups um inside of trust and safety. And so we think about um everything from earnings, like how do we think about making sure the earnings process that happens for the Spark driver. How do we think about um compliance laws that are coming in um across the different uh states.

- Unknown (4/30/25 1:52 PM): Um, as we build new models, right? As we build and become more automated, what's that governance look like, right? And we have to have also really strong governance to do real models and think about it because this is describing our platform and how do we make sure we have that all done in the right way. Um, partnering a lot with Sarah, right? In that group and like how do we do this as we start to scale? This is a new muscle for us like as a company and we got to continue to focus and build on that.

- Unknown (4/30/25 1:53 PM): Um, I'm going to hit oh, program management. Like hearing a little bit, uh, Mo is going to talk a little bit about like some of the things that we've been working on. you guys have been working on with the CIA. Like we have a lot of governance going on. We need to do this actually here with the state. So how do we make sure we've got the right program management team to help support the group on all the things that we want.

- Unknown (4/30/25 1:53 PM): what that structure is like. So we have a structure time what we literally over but for society and it's interesting enough to see us to to digitally we're having a period of needs that to share about the structure, what options in the strategy. But I think it's important like for example collaboration just a big one. So this thing essentially what it does is just bring all the teams together, right? So we are the glue of the team. So we make sure also that we work with the strategy for the and for LVs but also plus.

- Unknown (4/30/25 1:54 PM): So when we say strategy, we also talk about how we work and collaborate functionally with other uh business partners that we have like product prioritization, uh mechanisms as well as part of the strategy. And performance management in this case we decided to separate that as a pillar because everything I I have a thing that if you cannot measure something is always better.

- Unknown (4/30/25 1:54 PM): So, uh, and we have to actually move into being more robust on how we measure ourselves. And how we help all the pillars to measure themselves. We also have data accuracy and that we are all we have.

- Unknown (4/30/25 1:54 PM): So that's why we have uh performance management and Sarah their own. And then also we're going to have a pillar with cross functional 360 programs to use to be vertical like uh in the in the OBT's case, but the operational part of that is moving into Robert platform. So we're going to keep them everything PMO and making sure that we work.

- Unknown (4/30/25 1:55 PM): all the uh with all the verticals that we have. And lastly very important change management. I mean we're going to go, we're actually in the middle of a change and we're going to continue being in the middle of the change. And change management itself is a science. So how we help the teams walk through the change, how we make sure that the associates have the tools, the resources, the skills and how we prepare the teams, everyone, all of us to be prepared for that change.

- Unknown (4/30/25 1:55 PM): So that's it.

- Unknown (4/30/25 1:55 PM): So one thing I like to put is like people have seen a lot of change overall. This is fresh slide. almost everyone's seen this for the first time. This is the bird eye view. There's more detail I think each of your leaders will spend time. I think how we this might mean some people have had like a slight change in function. Some the same job just a different team or different sitting or so a little bit of work doing the same thing. So I think we'll to be each of these bullet points or slides.

- Unknown (4/30/25 1:56 PM): being behind there. It's possible to get the entire work in one slide but I think it's the best job with that and we'll all work out the details in the coming weeks basically.

- Unknown (4/30/25 1:56 PM): I think one of the things that we were working.

- Unknown (4/30/25 1:56 PM): work to everyone is working on the right work. Right? So I don't think none of the the work doesn't change. How we structure ourselves to make sure we can go faster and we can scale that work is something that we're spending time thinking about and talking about as a group. Um, and also so we can provide clarity for this room and everyone on the call of where we see a team are going in the future. And if you start to think about um career progression and where you want to go grow your career, you've got real clarity of how we're thinking about this space um and where we're going to be and continue to develop. So that was kind of in to to last point is a lot more detail over this.

- Unknown (4/30/25 1:57 PM): just share kind of the overarching of kind of how I was thinking about it. I always want to first start off um because we got some big goals ahead, right? We hit the big goals, like we've got some big stuff ahead. Um the business is counting on us, our customer is counting on us. Um and I'm just really looking forward to it. Like there's already so much done this year and we just have to come.

- Unknown (4/30/25 1:57 PM): All right, we will um we're going to have Chris uh Knight talk a little bit of kind of like the a big work finding update. Um and then we're going to have Chris spend you think about that experience and trust that we've marked out kind of like the priority. And then we're going to kind of spend some highlight time talking about the trust side. So we'll have uh Mo and Rocky talk about some of like the highlights of work that you guys have been doing, which is really helping us drive trust across the.

- Unknown (4/30/25 1:58 PM): Thank you.

- Unknown (4/30/25 1:58 PM): Um, you know, there's one thing worse than listening to somebody about finance is listening to somebody about finance.

- Unknown (4/30/25 1:58 PM): So I'll try I'll try to keep it brief everybody. I'm I'm Chris Knight. Um I have the pleasure of supporting you all um through financials. Um today I wanted to spend a few minutes talking about the investment community meeting that happened a couple weeks ago. Um anybody watch it or listen to it by chance?

- Unknown (4/30/25 1:58 PM): Well, I got one taker. All right. That's okay. I'll um I'll talk you guys through it. It's it's a meeting that happens every two years. Uh Walmart hosts investors um and analysts to to attend a meeting where we talk about what's going on in our business. Um this year the meeting was held in Dallas and we had 150 um investors and analysts on site and another 3,000 um watched online.

- Unknown (4/30/25 1:59 PM): So it was a really successful event. But what's going on in the world today? Right? Why in the world would we host a meeting about investing when we've got like turmoil happening in the markets, right? Well, part of that is because we believe um that this is an opportunity really, right? We see this as an opportunity for us to get in front of investors and show the investment community why you should believe in Walmart. Um Walmart historically has done really well in times of um unrest in the markets, right? Recessions, etc. Walmart does really well. And so we wanted to lean into that.

- Unknown (4/30/25 1:59 PM): So our goal was to make three goals. Really we wanted to again, reassure the uh the investment community that um we can handle any of this kind of time, right? Um, we wanted to show them that our our priorities are clear, right? We're going to focus on price. Making sure that our customers um can get their groceries at a good price, right? We wanted to make them um tell them about our ways that we're going to manage inventory and control costs, right?

- Unknown (4/30/25 2:00 PM): And then we just wanted to reassure them that like when the waters are choppy, our our priorities are clear. We know exactly where we're going, right? So it was all about um setting a a like a a calm and credible tone. So Doug did that. Doug started by talking about our purpose, right? We've already talked about Burton talked about it. People led, had power. talked about our CDP, right? Um you guys don't know what that means. Awesome. Um and then John David got up and talked about and John David is our is our CFO. Um brought back a familiar financial model, which if you've been around finance for a while like I have, is something that we've talked about for a really long time. We kind of stopped talking about it, but it's growth margins and returns. So it was really good again, all about kind of making

- Unknown (4/30/25 2:01 PM): you guys take a step back, not freak out, right? It's going to be okay. All right. You can go to the next slide.

- Unknown (4/30/25 2:01 PM): I just have one thing. I think one of the one of the one that you can get something but I honestly I'm going to say after that anytime you guys are the states, right? And you think you're done. Just I think just involved those uh having meeting that you can you can come out of that like it's going to take a couple of hours to go through it, but you can confidently say I understand what our CDP wants to do with the company going forward. And you can come out very clear on the support that I think it's one of the best overall that we have. like this I think the amount of the big talk made of Doug's comments like more of us coming like I think how he handled every question on and reminder this happened just a few days like two or three days after the that was announced and how he answered the investor community and calmed everyone down on like this is what we're going to do, we're going to focus on what we're on and how he's coming to every question I found that like lessons in how to engage with investors, how to bring down in a time of crisis and I think it's just a good example.

- Unknown (4/30/25 2:02 PM): Uh.

- Unknown (4/30/25 2:02 PM): I agree. And so while Doug and John David were talking about the company Walmart Inc as a whole, um about staying calm in the chaos, there was one really exciting thing that was discussed about e-commerce. E-commerce is now profitable, y'all. Like that's unheard of. And not only that, but we are expected for this whole year to be profitable. Um and that's that e-commerce I'm talking about. Um a full year ahead of when we told the investment community that we were going to be profitable.

- Unknown (4/30/25 2:02 PM): Which channels one of those profitable channels that become?

- Unknown (4/30/25 2:03 PM): Absolutely. So it's amazing, y'all. Like we're folks we're focused on the right things, right? And um and we're we're doing it. I think it's just amazing. You guys should uh really be proud of yourselves for for making that happen. Um.

- Unknown (4/30/25 2:03 PM): Yeah.

- Unknown (4/30/25 2:03 PM): Sherry, you have a question.

- Unknown (4/30/25 2:03 PM): Sherry.

- Unknown (4/30/25 2:03 PM): All right.

- Unknown (4/30/25 2:03 PM): One of the things that Doug and Gina talked about um in his in his remarks was about the Omni customer, right? So an Omni customer is someone that buys in store and online. Um what's really interesting about the Omni customer is that they spend about three times, they shop with us three times more often than a buying store customer only. And then if you think about that Omni customer and how that translates to fast delivery, so if you place a fast delivery order, your spend is double that of a buying store um customer. And if you purchase four orders, then the spend triples. So everything we're talking about earlier about our focus on fast delivery, there's a reason why, right? It's profitable, y'all. Like it makes financial sense, it makes sense for our customers, um so we're going to keep doing it. So as you can imagine and see over here, the investment community um responded, analysts responded favorably. They wrote nice articles about us. But more than that,

- Unknown (4/30/25 2:04 PM): Our investors respond. go to the next slide.

- Unknown (4/30/25 2:04 PM): So I'm going to risk peeking out a bit over here on the on the stock ticker.

- Unknown (4/30/25 2:04 PM): Um what I want you to take away from this slide is not, oh my gosh, look at this great slide of stock price.

- Unknown (4/30/25 2:04 PM): But really opening price to 9:00 a.m.

- Unknown (4/30/25 2:05 PM): This is when Doug and John David were talking.

- Unknown (4/30/25 2:05 PM): Right? So you can see very clearly the the market reacted to our call.

- Unknown (4/30/25 2:05 PM): Right? It's really amazing to see that.

- Unknown (4/30/25 2:05 PM): And then you can see some crazy stuff happening over here, but forgetting all that, it was still just a nice trajectory and the market really responded well to to what we had to say.

- Unknown (4/30/25 2:05 PM): Um okay. So straighten off, but what does it mean to us? How are we going to continue to win?

- Unknown (4/30/25 2:05 PM): go to the next slide. Um this is what really excites me as a finance guy.

- Unknown (4/30/25 2:05 PM): We have really lofty goals, really ambitious goals, but we have a really strong track record of meeting our goals, okay?

- Unknown (4/30/25 2:05 PM): This year, our customers are going to spend $36 billion in delivery.

- Unknown (4/30/25 2:06 PM): And we're going to fulfill 517 million deliveries.

- Unknown (4/30/25 2:06 PM): That's amazing. That's a ton, right?

- Unknown (4/30/25 2:06 PM): Um and we're doing that by all the work that you're doing.

- Unknown (4/30/25 2:06 PM): Right? Expanding catchments, making it easier for customers to get those fast deliveries, make sure that we have drivers available.

- Unknown (4/30/25 2:06 PM): Um and great to spend funding on IT and IT is not like you look at this 30% growth.

- Unknown (4/30/25 2:06 PM): That's great.

- Unknown (4/30/25 2:06 PM): This is not small. I think if you compare it to what any other 25, 27 billion dollar business, being able to deliver 30% on top operating at 0% business is very huge and is a huge highlight for me.

- Unknown (4/30/25 2:06 PM): If you look at any quarterly learning report of our competition, that's out there, they cannot even celebrate this much growth and that's really.

- Unknown (4/30/25 2:06 PM): And not only that, but we don't feel like we're hitting any kind of ceiling, right? So that's the that's the really fun part for me is that like not only do I think we can do 36, but I think we can do 40% on top of that next year, right?

- Unknown (4/30/25 2:07 PM): It's really fun.

- Unknown (4/30/25 2:07 PM): Um we're going to think about costs.

- Unknown (4/30/25 2:07 PM): I wanted to on something really cool too is is that, you know, when our customers have a really good experience, right?

- Unknown (4/30/25 2:07 PM): They purchase more. When they purchase more, we create density. we create density, we lower our cost per order, right?

- Unknown (4/30/25 2:07 PM): And when we when we lower that cost per order, then we can reinvest back in the customer and it just creates a nice little flywheel. Um but that's how you get this leverage number. Leverage is expenses as a percentage of GMB.

- Unknown (4/30/25 2:07 PM): So every year we're spending less for every dollar that is spent.

- Unknown (4/30/25 2:07 PM): Um which is great, great stuff, you guys.

- Unknown (4/30/25 2:07 PM): Um so with that, I just want to say thank you. Uh thanks for letting me support you. You guys are an amazing group and I'm I'm really excited to see what you guys do this year. Let me know if you have any questions, happy to support.

- Unknown (4/30/25 2:08 PM): Thank you.

- Unknown (4/30/25 2:08 PM): Hey guys. Do you guys hear me? Is it okay?

- Unknown (4/30/25 2:08 PM): Yeah.

- Unknown (4/30/25 2:08 PM): Okay, awesome. Um so I think it's my turn next. I'm going to move on to the next slide.

- Unknown (4/30/25 2:08 PM): All right. So guys, my team, so my name is Rafi. I'm on Mo's team, um under Ness's organization, part of Last Mile Delivery Spark. And my team has a few primary functions, right? And the one we're most passionate about is creating an intuitive and defect free experience within the Spark app for our users.

- Unknown (4/30/25 2:08 PM): Now, we're really passionate about it because as an experience that just works, really becomes rather sticky for our drivers. They stay with us longer. And for those of you that didn't know, drivers who go stay with us beyond their first 100 trips are not only significantly more uh cheaper to maintain, they have lower contact propensity, but they deliver significantly improved experiences for our delivery customers, which is why it's important.

- Unknown (4/30/25 2:09 PM): And what's unique about Sparks in context on the next slide that I'm going to share with you, we're sharing with you two capabilities today that have about a year of work behind them, is that Spark is probably the first example of a real digital ecosystem that extends across a broad set of user groups. And what I mean is is the Spark driver delivery experience is essentially an ecosystem with three groups, associates, customers, drivers, all together where we use 90 different APIs and over 400 services behind the back end of the app to essentially uh facilitate interactions between these these groups. And when we do it really well, we deliver a great experience and it's rather profitable for us, speaking to the great results that we just shared here.

- Unknown (4/30/25 2:09 PM): The two features we're going to go through are mission control. How are we practically monitoring and enabling upstream issue detection across uh LD for Spark. And then how are we using vertical AI, generative AI, large language models to kind of help accelerate and triage defects that we find further upstream, sort of compressing the time from issue discovery to organizational response. Can we go to the next slide real quick?

- Unknown (4/30/25 2:10 PM): Awesome. So if you click over a couple times, what you'll see is that this is kind of our current state of how defects occur, right? A defect escapes earlier stages of production, as the app starts to scale and drivers adopt it, they start to experience this issue. They start to generate calls. If you click over again two times, they start to go ahead and send us emails, they start to send chats. And if you click over once more or twice more I should before you know it, the contact center is on fire. And this happens for hundreds of issues, right? When we don't discover them further upstream.

- Unknown (4/30/25 2:10 PM): All right? So let me go to the next slide. This is uh we're going to the next slide here. So this is where mission control comes in, right? And mission control is a function that is essentially, think of it as um it we're weaving together multiple analytics components, vertical and and generative AI models, um and we sort of it's powered by analytics to basically actively looking for issues to size, triage. And what they're doing is predicting what's going to become a P1, right? And we have really good historical data that lets us feel confident about these predictions. Because when you predict that something's going to cause delivery success impact and driver user impact, then you start triaging it.

- Unknown (4/30/25 2:11 PM): Can can you guys mute?

- Unknown (4/30/25 2:11 PM): Sorry. Um is everybody else hearing that or is that just me?

- Unknown (4/30/25 2:11 PM): Okay. All right. No no worries, sorry. Um and so what this group does is it triggers kind of our our our defect reduction playbook and there are four key functions here. So the first one is early detection. We're actively listening to the social verse to determine if something is going on and we start to actively triage this. These groups are sitting in tech pod chats, all this stuff. We also are drafting communications. So when we feel that something is going to happen, we're able to send communications to multiple audience inclusing the agents that are supporting our drivers, right? Which kind of gives them a heads up that we've detected an issue and how to support someone that's impacted by that. And then we do real time notification to kick off the triage experience, right? If one of our sister teams, the aura team has detected it yet.

- Unknown (4/30/25 2:12 PM): And the last thing we monitor, right? Live through these issues to kind of send out closed issues. Now I'm going to speed through these next few slides. So you're going to have to bear with me on on the clicking here. If you go to the next slide here, this is what we're able to do today, right? Now that mission control is live. What we're essentially doing is we're leveraging generative AI and vertical AI models to essentially take the previous flow you saw, right? Where call volume is sort of the indicator that something's wrong, right? And that there's a problem. So now using public data, right?

- Unknown (4/30/25 2:12 PM): Which is a good leading indicator essentially that we're going to get call volume and essentially automate the first four steps. We're compressing the time from issue discovery to triage or mediation and deploying that fixes. Essentially we've been able proactive intervention. And how it works, if you click on the next slide here, the clicking number to the next slide is we see a symptom, right? A symptom is caught and we investigate and try to replicate. If you can click over once more for me, please.

- Unknown (4/30/25 2:10 PM): further upstream.

- Unknown (4/30/25 2:10 PM): Hey, it's like moving on to the next slide.

- Unknown (4/30/25 2:10 PM): This is uh moving on to the next slide here. So this is where mission control comes in, right?

- Unknown (4/30/25 2:10 PM): And mission control is a function that is essentially, think of it as um it we're weaving together multiple analytics components, vertical and and generative AI models. Um and we sort of it's powered by analysts that basically actively looking for issues to size, triage, and what they're doing is predicting what's going to become a P1, right?

- Unknown (4/30/25 2:11 PM): And we have a let me give you historical data that lets you have confidence about these predictions, because when you predict that something's going to cause delivery success impact and driver user impact, and you start triaging that there.

- Unknown (4/30/25 2:11 PM): can can can you guys mute?

- Unknown (4/30/25 2:11 PM): Sorry.

- Unknown (4/30/25 2:11 PM): Is everybody else hearing that or is that just me?

- Unknown (4/30/25 2:11 PM): Okay. All right. No no worries, sorry. Um and so what this group does is it triggers kind of our our our defect reduction playbook and there are four key functions here. So the first one is early detection. We're actively listening to the social verse to determine if something is going on and we start to actively triage this. These groups are sitting in tech pod chats, all this stuff. We also are drafting communications, so when we feel that something's going to happen, we're able to send communications to multiple audience including the agents that are supporting our drivers, right?

- Unknown (4/30/25 2:12 PM): Which kind of gives them a heads up that we've detected an issue and how to support someone that's impacted by that. And then we do real-time notification to kick off the triage experience, right?

- Unknown (4/30/25 2:12 PM): If one of our sister teams, the OR team hasn't detected it yet. And then lastly we monitor, right? Live through these issues to kind of send out closed issues. Now I'm going to speed through these next few slides. So you have to bear with me on on the clicking here. They go to the next slide here. This is what we're able to do today, right?

- Unknown (4/30/25 2:12 PM): Now that mission control is live. What we're essentially doing is we're leveraging generative AI and vertical AI models to essentially take the previous flow you saw, right? Where call volume is sort of the indicator that something's wrong, right? And that there's a problem. So now use a couple of data, right? Which is a good leading indicator essentially that we're going to get call volume and essentially automate the first four steps. We're compressing the time from issue discovery to triage, remediation and deploying that fixes. Essentially we've been able proactive intervention. And how it works, if you click on the next slide here.

- Unknown (4/30/25 2:13 PM): So clicking over to the next slide, as we see a symptom, right? A symptom is caught and we investigate and try to replicate. You can click over once more for me, please.

- Unknown (4/30/25 2:13 PM): We establish first if it's uh essentially we're trying to predict how likely is it that this is going to create disproportionate call volume and is it going to create an abnormal impact to delivery success. And then you click over here, again, and you see we also take a look is this a new or existing issue? Is it above the baseline? And if you click over once more, and we then gather all of the data that we use in mission control. So not only can we see the issue, replicate it and attempt to understand how pervasive it is.

- Unknown (4/30/25 2:13 PM): We can also determine what version of the app that drivers are experiencing this on. We can also use geolocation capabilities within our sprinkler tool set at mission control to determine what region may be experiencing this issue. Perhaps there's an experiment in that region that we're scaling, right? Here in the example you're seeing that the largest impact is in Oregon across multiple zones. And then if you if you click over once more, we're able to bring this to our triage calls and essentially accelerate solution deployment with our sister teams with OR and other folks.

- Unknown (4/30/25 2:14 PM): And so through automation and AI, we're actually compressing this time to ensure that we're proactively intervening further upstream in many cases before the first call is even detected um right in our service center, which is a really big difference from the reactive approach that we had prior as a platform. And we've had a lot of successes here. So if we go to the next slide here, I'm only going to cover two or three successes here for you just in the interest of time. Out of the four key areas, the biggest shift that we've done is we've actually gone from being reactive to proactive. So we're detecting things further upstream and compressing the time it takes to resolve them. In many cases, we are resolving this before a single driver is impacted, right?

- Unknown (4/30/25 2:14 PM): We've actually generated over $400,000 in care savings today just in contact reduction from identifying issues proactively that we were able to remediate before a single call was generated. The other thing that we're doing is we're actually resolving these 10 times faster and with 30% fewer contacts when there's an active P1 because of the mitigation strategies we deploy. And we've also moved where 60% of our overall issues that we discover, we discover them before they generate call volume, which is a significant difference in what we're doing here. And moving on to the next slide here.

- Unknown (4/30/25 2:15 PM): This is the second function that we're talking about. So if you click once, what's live is what's in the bottom row here for us. We have a proactive insights and testing team which has to date um identified 65 P1s and kept them from going into production. We've been able to partner with engineering to solve them. We're using social media as an indicator to predict P1s and actually initiate our mitigation playbook. We're also monitoring APIs in real time so that we can actually see whenever the baseline volume of an API changes and we're doing this in partnership not just ourselves but with Sungum, with Ruchit and team on the engineering side, who are all critical stakeholders for us. And what's coming next, what we're showing you here, you click once more, this is now using vertical AI to generate conversational insights. Essentially, we can take agent transcripts, agent notes, um and anything that happens on a call and we can trace a single order across every contact that it's generated and across every driver that it's actually generated that contact and agent to understand new potential insights. And we're going to share one use case example here before we wrap up. So moving on to the next slide here.

- Unknown (4/30/25 2:16 PM): Keep going for me. So this was a the conversational insights that we tested and piloted. And if you go to the next slide, um what we're doing here to give you guys an idea of how this works is we're using the same type of AI that is used in the healthcare industry to either challenge or can or uh confirm a diagnosis. And as it's ingesting contacts, transcripts, uh feedback, in app feedback sessions, NPS surveys, we're pumping everything into this, the AI itself is able to provide suggestive and correlated root causes that may be behind it. And what these do is these actually provide hints for us as to which systems on the back end of those 90 APIs and over 400 services may be responsible for what's causing the issue. As you can see here, there are multiple root causes being detected in this particular earnings issue. We can even tag the team that's involved in this once we get this at scale so that they're aware of an issue that we're currently tracking and triaging. And we applied this to a live use case that we had done previously. So if you move to the last two slides here.

- Unknown (4/30/25 2:17 PM): This is a use case on ghost orders. And to make this quick for everyone, if you're not familiar with ghost ordering, it's essentially an experience where a driver accepts an offer on the app, they show up to a store and after waiting only to be told that either it's not there, they can't find it or it's been given to a previous driver. We actually did an analysis with our previous tool set, which took us 60 days, reviewing thousands of contacts, looking at agent notes, and we determined two major root causes. One was associate driven. We were really fond of that add driver button and we were able to pass enhancements that allowed us to control that behavior a bit. And then second, there was an FMS cancellation issue where the FMS cancellation signal wasn't making it um right all the way across. So indeed we were still searching for a driver for an order that had been canceled. This was worth about $3 million in care savings when we tested it. So we reran this same use case and with the models that we just showcased on the next slide here.

- Unknown (4/30/25 2:18 PM): And what we were able to determine, this is a real ghost order. So what we were able to do here is in a couple of clips, we identified a validated ghost order. We then created a category where this is what a ghost order sounds like. We then retroactively pulled multiple examples. In this case, we assessed 18,000 ghost orders.

- Unknown (4/30/25 2:18 PM): Here, you're seeing a single order that generated 17 contacts across eight different L2s. And what we learned by doing this analysis, which we didn't have capabilities for, is ghost orders are actually far more costly than we actually anticipated. The average CPD of a ghost order is about $25 versus at the time it was $6.

- Unknown (4/30/25 2:19 PM): At scale, we get about 1.7, 1.8 contacts for every 100 orders. Well, every ghost order generates around three and a half contacts, right? The average cost per contact is $11. In this particular order, this cost per contact was $87. It took us two hours and five minutes to support this order. Um, and spoiler alert, it actually uh was a canceled order that the customer had picked up. Signals hadn't just gone across.

- Unknown (4/30/25 2:19 PM): We paid $110 in delivery fees for this order, and we assigned it to over 87 drivers. And so we took our learnings from the AI model and and the next slide here, we actually determined that there were more than 20 root causes and we had missed close to $44 million in road net value. Um, by resolving all of these use cases. We've actually deployed close to half of them as part of SDM. We're continuing to work the rest. But these are the capabilities that mission control and what conversational insights can do for defect detection.

- Unknown (4/30/25 2:19 PM): But the team has been working on for over a year and is now starting to come alive. And then to close it all up for you guys, if you go on the last slide here, we're actually building for the enterprise. So we can use this same technology in any new order tech that we drive, in any new region that we open, and we can use something called organic discovery where the vertical LLM and generative models can actually map our issue types, tell us what's statistically most likely to deliver a great support reaction, help us build intent and taxonomy across the regions, and help us understand what's driving contacts and how do we reduce them.

- Unknown (4/30/25 2:20 PM): And so, I know I threw a lot at you guys. I tried to be as speedy as I could. Um, thank you for giving me the time. We're excited about the work and and we've been meeting with folks across the board, Mexico, Canada, and other folks to talk about how can we take what we're learning here and apply it across other regions, um, and bring this value up, sir.

- Unknown (4/30/25 2:20 PM): Thank you.

- Unknown (4/30/25 2:20 PM): Thank you, Ralph.

- Unknown (4/30/25 2:20 PM): That means been waiting for you to get up.

- Unknown (4/30/25 2:20 PM): I just should have just done that from there actually.

- Unknown (4/30/25 2:21 PM): And as I walked up, um, I see a lot of reactions that hey, this is guy again, he's going to talk to us about the hard, how everything's burning and how we need to work harder or faster, um, uh, to to save the platform. Although that is true, but today I want to take a slightly different approach, uh, and maybe reflect back to the journey of.

- Unknown (4/30/25 2:21 PM): Um, I think early last year is when we started GFR. And just for context for folks here, right? Essentially what we're trying to do is bring together any and all risk on the platform, around the platform, whether that has to do with uh fraud, litigation, changes in regulat- regulations, changes in our um platform as you know, um the other uh speakers Rebecca and Chris talked about.

- Unknown (4/30/25 2:21 PM): With all that growth, right? Our platform also needed to then grow and become stable. So we took uh inventory of all the risk things that we had to do earlier last year and we baptized them into five different work streams and we started working on them. So essentially that is what your heart was about. However, late last year though we realized that the velocity of issues that we're discovering, um, was outpacing our ability to fix them, right? So what did we do? We took a.

- Unknown (4/30/25 2:22 PM): whole group and took uh one of the largest growing areas and we put a complete freeze on it. Right? So we essentially stopped the entire product road map to focus everything on your heart. And that also came with asking all of you to change your direction and pivot all the attention towards. Um, and one thing that I've been tremendously impressed about and and I want this theme of this talk to be around that grateful about is how quickly everybody rolled up their sleeves and jumped in, right? Um, if you go into the next slide, in a very short amount of time.

- Unknown (4/30/25 2:22 PM): If you look at this slide, I want you to focus on all these dots that we have accomplished. I'm not going to go through all these um details here, but I just want you to kind of take that in that from a very short period of time, we're able to come in and actually deliver this together. And in this process, you know, we asked you to pivot into areas that you have no ideas about, right? Full of ambiguity ambiguity, uh, but you all came together. Um, so I want to take a moment to say thank you. Having said that, with all this progress we've made, we're at a we're at a very critical point uh in our journey here where tech is actually almost ready to deploy some of the largest um enhancements initiatives that we have ever seen. For example, CMS migration coming up. We're we're moving the entire driver base, all the records, all the details of drivers that we have into a new system, right? And we got to do that in a pretty short amount of time while we face two big events. I think Rebecca mentioned earlier that each event is our largest volume day. So now imagine that at the same time that we're delivering a a very important strategy for the company, serving millions of customers, we're taking millions of data for the 1.5, 2 million drivers and moving it around at the same time. All while uh you know, um serving for the holidays. Probably the worst time to do it, but this is this is the place point that we're at. So the message that I want to take away here is thank you for all your support, but please continue to focus on um especially the next about 60 to 90 days is going to be very, very critical as we stabilize and kind of rebaseline ourselves as a large platform.

- Unknown (4/30/25 2:25 PM): team and all of our partners, your commitment and dedication. I know it wasn't easy, right? And with this change came a lot of sacrifice, both on professional um area as well as your personal um uh selves as well, right? I remember Amelia when we were doing Amelia, we actually stayed in the office for I think 24

- Unknown (4/30/25 2:25 PM): So I just want to say thank you, right? I want us to all from myself, myself as well as the leadership team here. And also I'm sure Karen would also echo this. This is not an easy task. What we have achieved here is making history. So I just want to take a moment and give you guys all a big time.

- Unknown (4/30/25 2:25 PM): Um with this, um I think what we've done is with all the effort that you guys have put in, we've kind of achieved um a new level of stability on the platform. And as we as we look forward now going in, obviously, let's keep the focus on the things that we we have to deliver. Uh but there is some exciting news that I do want to share with you. You can go ahead to the next slide here. Um and that is that majority of 90% of the at risk Vegas initiatives will be delivered by July, right? This is why I need you guys all still holding hands and keeping the lights on. At the same time though, would love to is a really exciting

- Unknown (4/30/25 2:26 PM): to be able to announce that we will be able to, we're on the path to unlock uh capacity both on the product side and as well as on your projects to then go back into the roles that you guys, you know, are more passionate about, the projects that you so passionately put together that we have paused to start picking those up in Q2.

- Unknown (4/30/25 2:26 PM): Finally.

- Unknown (4/30/25 2:26 PM): Yeah.

- Unknown (4/30/25 2:27 PM): But at the same time now we're at the other point of transition, right? So as we transition back, what I would like us to do um is as you guys saw the new work structure, new work are forming, new people are coming in, there's going to be some backfield roles that we open up. Just one request I have is let's make sure all this momentum and achievements we've had doesn't take, you know, doesn't fall. Make sure it's transferred over, transition over well. Um and I think uh the last thing I'll leave us with is uh um I want you guys to all feel like an immense sense of pride, immense sense of accomplishment in this, right? I know it was uh it was difficult and I want to say again, uh thank you for your gift to us as a new bar of stability for the platform. That's all I have.

- Unknown (4/30/25 2:28 PM): We are so close, right? On some of these big things, like to both point, have to keep the focus, right? That's a lot of data, that's a lot of driver information, it's a lot of stability that we have to deliver. So we still got a lot to do. We got to get over that big hump and land it. I think the only other thing I would add is is yes, we are going to start working towards the the projects that have been put on hold. But we are also committed to, we are going to maintain engineering resources and focus in this space. So like this space going forward, we are going to continue to invest in um back to like scalability and stability. Um it's going to be a continued area of focus. And so we're really excited about the new stuff, but it also means that we are going to go and start forward on the next set of things that we know we need to do in the trust and safety space. So just huge kudos. We're not through the tunnel yet. Light though on the other side. Um but then it's say how do we continue to just make this part of our everyday ways of working, right? So if you think about that like cross functional uh trust and safety, we want it to become part of our ways of working and not just have to inject programs in times, right? So as we as we think about your roles, how do you start to embed things that we've learned through the last six months into just the projects at the beginning, right? So we can make sure that we can continue to scale this. So that would be maybe the one thing I'd add is let's think about how we like raise the bar and now we just get to continue to raise the bar um because we'll warm it and we'll celebrate right now for like 30 seconds and then spend the next, you know, year talking about what next best thing we can do. So I just appreciate, I want to like echo, I I didn't have the opportunity to be here during those 24-hour nights, but just thank you for everything you've done to get us into this position.

- Unknown (4/30/25 2:29 PM): I'll be on that note, um I'm already seeing a mindset shift on every project that we have come across with the that we just talked about. To carry that on as the world changes and develops, please pass that on and make sure those mechanisms stick and establish as we move forward.

- Unknown (4/30/25 2:30 PM): going forward, now looking at the future, anything and everything that we do, look at what risk that is. Make it a part of the beginning of every project. Even if it's a project going positively, any other areas like how do we ensure we have thought about not just like what we are going to do, what are all the risks that are potentially and if from the very beginning plan for it, integrated it, thought through it and that's part of part of ensuring that we do well reducing risk along the way rather than don't get stuck in and I have to that the amount of risk is growing as faster than the amount of solutions we delivering. We always know what we have.

- Unknown (4/30/25 2:31 PM): But thank you. Oh sorry.

- Unknown (4/30/25 2:31 PM): Sorry. And another thing is just like we also rolled out a bunch of governance protocols and ecosystem frameworks um that helps us catch those risks early on. So make sure we keep implementing those and following those.

- Unknown (4/30/25 2:31 PM): Plus plus 100.

- Unknown (4/30/25 2:31 PM): All right, um I think this is the recognition stage, but before we get into recognitions, I just want to give a quick update on an exciting initiative uh that we're rolling out across Last Mile. Uh it's called the Gen AI knowledge engine. I know another AI terminology that's being thrown around, but this one's exciting. I promise. Not that the other one's not.

- Unknown (4/30/25 2:32 PM): This one comes with less fires. Less uh conference fires.

- Unknown (4/30/25 2:32 PM): So basically, um as you all know, we've built a vast incredible amount of knowledge um over the last few years across this team, right? We've um we've built large strategic programs that have redefined industry standards. We've worked on some hard problems. We've dealt with complex um spaces. But the problem is this knowledge is kind of dissipated across uh sometimes it's in our minds, sometimes it's across conference pages or buried in SharePoint folders. Um and it's difficult for us to sometimes find those source of truth answers to some of those basic questions. Um so what this tool will allow us to do is we want to make that information more accessible to everyone, intelligently and instantly.

- Unknown (4/30/25 2:32 PM): Um

- Unknown (4/30/25 2:32 PM): Um and so this tool, uh essentially you can go and ask this tool a question and it should spit out what um uh what that question should be, but in the context of your uh what the answer should be, but in the context of your question, um and relevant to what you want to drive towards.

- Unknown (4/30/25 2:33 PM): Now, in order to roll out this tool, uh we needed help. Um so we had asked your leaders uh for folks that can help us that we were um laying their knowledge hands.

- Unknown (4/30/25 2:33 PM): Uh so these are the folks that would come out and work with their teams to identify, tag, um organize uh the confluence pages and SharePoint folders and files. I mean this is a massive task, right? If you just consider, if you just take a moment and go through confluence, you know how many confluence pages there are, right?

- Unknown (4/30/25 2:33 PM): So these are the folks um that I wanted to just take a moment uh to recognize and thank uh for volunteering, maybe even some some situations being long told, um but still choosing uh to help.

- Unknown (4/30/25 2:33 PM): Um and I think what makes this even more meaningful, um is that some of these folks um, you know, because of their personal reasons have decided not to um uh come to Bentonville. But they're still deciding and choosing to help out with this project.

- Unknown (4/30/25 2:34 PM): And I think that speaks volumes of their character, um but also that it's a it's a testament um to the pride they feel in what they've built um over the years here and and that the fact that they want to see this continue uh with the next chapter of us and and how we succeed.

- Unknown (4/30/25 2:34 PM): So thank you everyone. Um we're going to uh roll out this we're going to have a kickoff I think tomorrow, Neil, keep me honest, um with some of these knowledge champions. Uh but if you have any questions or interested in how you can help, feel free to reach out to me through it.

- Unknown (4/30/25 2:34 PM): Thank you.

- Unknown (4/30/25 2:36 PM): I didn't get that Shazam. I need to

- Unknown (4/30/25 2:36 PM): I think we only want between you and the cheer, but I think I'll just talk about two things right now. One is starting off with change. I think the last few months we've all been a lot of change together. I think every single person here has been some change whether it's like teams, roles, scope, something or the other has been changing in the last few months and I think it made me think a lot about like our beginning stories also and how we kicked off last time.

- Unknown (4/30/25 2:37 PM): I think every time we've been through a disruption, a crisis, a big change, I think come out of it and that change has been it's it's it's produced something even better than what we started off with and we we started our last mile team, we were in a very different stage and we were signing an exclusive partnership with Uber. So all of the work we're doing right now would not have existed. We had signed that Uber is going to be the exclusive last mile partners and we'll build everything.

- Unknown (4/30/25 2:37 PM): Uber tells us suddenly one day that hey we're not going to go ahead and invest in the last mile business. We're going to go focus on what

- Unknown (4/30/25 2:38 PM): that this is eight years ago and you can all see what we built right now. We were in 2019, we had a lot of questions on Spark like how is it working? Is it even delivering the right operations, the metrics, the cost.

- Unknown (4/30/25 2:38 PM): we came together and look at where we are now with Spark. We um we're still a multi carrier platform. We were in a state that most of our deliveries were being done by Door Dash. They came to one day like Door Dash is not going to serve all marketing code. Out of that like the growth of stuck. We went from a small few city pilot to becoming a large platform. Even like uh opportunistic things like we had a problem on uh capacity and store. There was a point we had actually stopped growing. All of the growth you're seeing 30, 40% numbers, we were hitting a peak because we were running out of back room space in the stores and out of that came shopper. I think every time we've been through

- Unknown (4/30/25 2:38 PM): some sort of crisis, they've come out stronger and I think the teams have come come has come up with something to leap frog, come up with something new, something different and how they've innovated this their way out of it. This time we've had a lot of change which has been more on the team side. I think we've had a lot of disruption, changes across multiple teams. Every team has had some or the other impact. We're now at a point that we're I think we have a lot of people here in the room, a lot of people about to move. So they're willing they're being okay, they've taken uh tough decision to move on move around here. We also just uh we're in the process of opening a lot of roles this week. We'll have a lot of new team members and now it's how do we come out of it and how do we build the team in the right way with the right like and not just to like just get back to normal, but how do we leap frog and set the team up for the next era is going to be really, really important.

- Unknown (4/30/25 2:39 PM): I think that's what I'm sitting out for anything else. I'm excited to see what we can find as an opportunity to leap frog. I think if we get back to normal just like get to find a way to keep the lights on the next couple of months. I think we can we as a team can easily do that. We've come together a lot of times and done that. I think but how do we come together as a team to even come out stronger in the next few months out of this is going to be key. How do we find something we've not thought about, something that wasn't top of mind for us when we were in a pretty good stage two, three months ago and like given a crisis, how do we do something different, something better than maybe we overall the system before.

- Unknown (4/30/25 2:40 PM): I think that's part of what we're saying how we automate our work, how do we use AI is going to be key. We're going to cut we're talking about it. AI is not going to go away anyway. Instead of AI happening to us, I think we all in each of our roles need to make sure how do we use it ourselves to get better and keep that a backup in your mind. I think you'll bring it back into the strategic excel that uh I think uh the last thing I'll just like reemphasize I talked about this a few town halls town halls ago, but just from the unique uh situation we're in with with the digital opportunity and there's if you look at all of our traditional retailers, nobody's gone and built a four last mile platform themselves. If you look at um the Insta cars, door dashes of the world, nobody has access to the four walls of the store and nobody has access and understanding of inventory and detail as well as we do.

- Unknown (4/30/25 2:41 PM): If you look at even Amazon, Amazon's doing great in terms of certain sections of the business, but in terms of fast delivery, they're way behind us. And that's actually our opportunity to leap frog Amazon and what we're doing. Like nobody can deliver hundreds of thousands of skews within three hours to customers for 95% of customers in the US. Even if you think about it from a driver perspective, every last mile platform is specializing in something or the other. I think what we're doing with cross retail delivery and shopping and doing like a package delivery routed model that FedEx UPS does the same time. I think a lot of the new things they're going to add over the next coming quarters.

- Unknown (4/30/25 2:41 PM): hopefully giving as many different types of opportunities for every type of driver out there. So if you look at any other retailer platform, any other uh driver place out there, I think what we're able to deliver overall, um nobody else is going to be. So I think it's it gives us a good foundation point and now it's up to us on what we build from this from this foundation. That's it. Excited to have everyone together in this room now. I think this is uh going to be something we're going to continue to want to bring everyone together.

- Unknown (4/30/25 2:42 PM): But that's it. We can we're going to close in the chair.

- Unknown (4/30/25 2:42 PM): you.

- Unknown (4/30/25 2:42 PM): you.

- Unknown (4/30/25 2:42 PM): Hey.

- Unknown (4/30/25 2:42 PM): Hey.

- Unknown (4/30/25 2:42 PM): Hell.

- Unknown (4/30/25 2:42 PM): Hell.

- Unknown (4/30/25 2:42 PM): Squiggly.

- Unknown (4/30/25 2:42 PM): Squiggly.

- Unknown (4/30/25 2:42 PM): Hell.

- Unknown (4/30/25 2:42 PM): Walmart. Who's Walmart is? My Walmart. Number one, the customer always.

- Unknown (4/30/25 2:43 PM): How you doing?

- Unknown (4/30/25 2:43 PM): Good. So you are here.

- Unknown (4/30/25 2:43 PM): I am. I'm here.

- Unknown (4/30/25 2:43 PM): Which part of the building? Are you in the same area there?

- Unknown (4/30/25 2:43 PM): We're we're uh downstairs, probably right below you. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, probably right below you. We uh we we haven't got our direction of where we sitting yet.

- Unknown (4/30/25 2:43 PM): Oh, not yet?

- Unknown (4/30/25 2:43 PM): No, no. We we just moved uh back to last mile delivery.

- Unknown (4/30/25 2:43 PM): Okay.

- Unknown (4/30/25 2:43 PM): We we're going to start off for a little bit, yeah.

- Unknown (4/30/25 2:43 PM): That'll be out of upstairs.

- Unknown (4/30/25 2:43 PM): You're upstairs?

- Unknown (4/30/25 2:43 PM): Over there.

- Unknown (4/30/25 2:43 PM): Yeah, about a long way from you.

- Unknown (4/30/25 2:43 PM): You're here downstairs, is it?

- Unknown (4/30/25 2:43 PM): No, no, no, no, no.

- Unknown (4/30/25 2:43 PM): We're we're we're probably right under uh where you where uh you are, yeah.

- Unknown (4/30/25 2:43 PM): Oh.

- Unknown (4/30/25 2:43 PM): Oh, yeah. Oh, shoot, yeah. We missed lunch. It's supposed to be closed.

- Unknown (4/30/25 2:43 PM): Yeah, come on. I know you get us out. We uh up there. It's time to move.

- Unknown (4/30/25 2:44 PM): You can't move.

- Unknown (4/30/25 2:44 PM): Until October anyway.

- Unknown (4/30/25 2:44 PM): Is that Oh, yeah, yeah.

- Unknown (4/30/25 2:44 PM): How about say October, that's that's our new move date. We're supposed to move in September, but.

- Unknown (4/30/25 2:44 PM): Okay.

- Unknown (4/30/25 2:44 PM): So in home is only DD, right? Not in home, right?

- Unknown (4/30/25 2:44 PM): No, we got both. So uh so owns both in home and and dedicated delivery.

- Unknown (4/30/25 2:44 PM): Oh.

- Unknown (4/30/25 2:44 PM): Yeah, so both of them came over to last mile delivery now. And he has DSPs too.

- Unknown (4/30/25 2:44 PM): Oh.

- Unknown (4/30/25 2:44 PM): When was this happen?

- Unknown (4/30/25 2:44 PM): It's just happened Friday.

- Unknown (4/30/25 2:44 PM): Tom Tom left, right? Oh, he's still here.

- Unknown (4/30/25 2:44 PM): No, Tom's gone. Tom uh stayed in New Jersey. Um she's a lot pretty much the whole team is gone. Cuz everybody was from California or New Jersey, yeah.

- Unknown (4/30/25 2:44 PM): You moved or something?

- Unknown (4/30/25 2:44 PM): Yeah, I moved, yeah. Yeah, I was in Dallas, but I moved here.

- Unknown (4/30/25 2:44 PM): 9 months ago, I guess.

- Unknown (4/30/25 2:44 PM): Oh, 9 months ago you moved.

- Unknown (4/30/25 2:45 PM): Yeah, 9 months ago. Have you always been here?

- Unknown (4/30/25 2:45 PM): Yeah.

- Unknown (4/30/25 2:45 PM): Okay, okay.

- Unknown (4/30/25 2:45 PM): Since 18.

- Unknown (4/30/25 2:45 PM): Huh?

- Unknown (4/30/25 2:45 PM): 2018.

- Unknown (4/30/25 2:45 PM): Yeah, 2018. So wait, you you were in the OR for me?

- Unknown (4/30/25 2:45 PM): Yeah. Oh, I didn't even know I had anybody here from.

- Unknown (4/30/25 2:45 PM): Oh, no, same team, but 22 I was in I moved to.

- Unknown (4/30/25 2:45 PM): Okay.

- Unknown (4/30/25 2:45 PM): Before that I was in business.

- Unknown (4/30/25 2:45 PM): Oh, okay.

- Unknown (4/30/25 2:45 PM): That's what I say.

- Unknown (4/30/25 2:45 PM): How long you're doing?

- Unknown (4/30/25 2:45 PM): Oh, yeah. Yeah.

- Unknown (4/30/25 2:45 PM): So I bet you've been all over this building, I guess. Well, you probably the global tech.

- Unknown (4/30/25 2:45 PM): Yeah, global tech.

- Unknown (4/30/25 2:45 PM): schedule for the talks.

- Unknown (4/30/25 2:45 PM): schedule?

- Unknown (4/30/25 2:45 PM): Yeah.

- Unknown (4/30/25 2:45 PM): You heard about schedule, right?

- Unknown (4/30/25 2:45 PM): Yeah, I heard about schedule. Yeah, they they will.

- Unknown (4/30/25 2:45 PM): Uh-huh.

- Unknown (4/30/25 2:45 PM): random from all our DCs and.

- Unknown (4/30/25 2:46 PM): Yeah, well we're talking about the app. That was one of the things. They was like, do you want to use schedule? I was like, oh.

- Unknown (4/30/25 2:46 PM): I don't know if it's relevant. It's a lot of stops. Trucks don't make that many stops.

- Unknown (4/30/25 2:46 PM): I think we might have to work a lot because of the.

- Unknown (4/30/25 2:46 PM): Oh, yeah.

- Unknown (4/30/25 2:46 PM): I'll get the office uh alignment as well when we're going to.

- Unknown (4/30/25 2:46 PM): Yeah.

- Unknown (4/30/25 2:46 PM): Yeah, I I cuz I figured from the dedicated side, it's probably not too much that you don't know already. Yeah. Uh cuz the API.

- Unknown (4/30/25 2:46 PM): Cuz I mean I I mean for right now at least the API connections are going to be the same. It's just the alerts that'll be be a little different, but.

- Unknown (4/30/25 2:46 PM): Lucky, right? I mean I I used to be in a district team.

- Unknown (4/30/25 2:46 PM): You just end up right back.

- Unknown (4/30/25 2:46 PM): Yeah, right.

- Unknown (4/30/25 2:46 PM): Okay. All right, I'll see you later.

- Unknown (4/30/25 2:48 PM): Yeah, exactly.

- Unknown (4/30/25 2:48 PM): Yeah, for sure.

- Unknown (4/30/25 2:48 PM): Yeah, I I have a good feeling you're going to have your shit in place after you're done.

- Unknown (4/30/25 2:50 PM): Monday or Tuesday. I was supposed to be off online.

- Unknown (4/30/25 2:50 PM): I said I don't know.

- Unknown (4/30/25 2:50 PM): I um it's not Monday. I I don't think it's Monday. I think it's Tuesday, but it's confusing because the Houston? No, no, no, no. Texas is uh May 6th. What happened in May 6th? There's an outage in Central DS9 or IP net. I don't know what. So many nights. Oh, is it because of the outage? Yeah, so there's an outage. So, but I'm confused because he said that that Monday is capped, but the outage is just from 5:00 p.m. to to whatever, yeah. So I would think that it's the next day. You know, it would be able to. So yeah, but the the trailer in the morning should come fine for for Monday, right? If Monday is 55, it would be Tuesday.

- Unknown (4/30/25 2:51 PM): It it should be Tuesday. I'm going to let Rich confirm because if there's caps in, maybe it's Monday and Tuesday. We just need to cancel for both days. But I'm going to let him confirm because that's confusing. If they capped it Monday, why would they cap it Monday if Yeah, that I mean me and Natasha talked about it and we were confused on that. We'll just reach out to them. Yeah, no, that makes sense.

- Unknown (4/30/25 2:51 PM): Also 29 19 33 11 are closed this weekend. You got a meeting. Oh, okay. Okay. Um did did you are you could reach out to the carriers already. I I told you. Okay.

- Unknown (4/30/25 2:52 PM): Perfect. And it's both Saturday Saturday and Sunday. And Saturday? Okay. And then Friday they they just capped the limited. And we're only at we're two vans at one store and one van at the other store. Yep. 2985 2980 and 3311 is 150. Okay. Yeah, we're just whatever it is, yeah. We'll we'll leave it alone. Um I mean if we have 150 packages at 3311, to be honest, those packages.

- Unknown (4/30/25 2:52 PM): just put some two days, right?

- Unknown (4/30/25 2:52 PM): They can do what?

- Unknown (4/30/25 2:52 PM): Two days. I mean, you can take.

- Unknown (4/30/25 2:52 PM): Yeah, but they're probably going to go out be a spark.

- Unknown (4/30/25 2:52 PM): Yeah.

- Unknown (4/30/25 2:52 PM): Yeah, they could. Yeah, they could.

- Unknown (4/30/25 2:52 PM): Technically, but we wouldn't want to um.

- Unknown (4/30/25 2:52 PM): Uh so what will happen? Why are we closing our stores because of Formula One? Because I I believe the track would be different, right? So is it like because there will be too much traffic in the city?

- Unknown (4/30/25 2:53 PM): I don't know if it's too much traffic. I think that it's too much traffic in the store. It's probably why they're shutting off IP.

- Unknown (4/30/25 2:53 PM): Because of Formula One.

- Unknown (4/30/25 2:53 PM): Yeah, because of Formula One. I think it's too much traffic through the store.

- Unknown (4/30/25 2:53 PM): things about road closure.

- Unknown (4/30/25 2:53 PM): And uh road closure, store traffic, and then also um employee employee availability. They might already have a high number of call offs because I'd imagine if you work out there, you're either not going to be able to leave your home or two, you're probably because these are people who

- Unknown (4/30/25 2:53 PM): to do high volume event. Yeah. the store cannot handle.

- Unknown (4/30/25 2:53 PM): So but I thought because it's a Formula Formula One event, right? So why would there will be more footfall or more audience from store?

- Unknown (4/30/25 2:53 PM): It'll be more traffic in the store, like physically in the store.

- Unknown (4/30/25 2:53 PM): But why?

- Unknown (4/30/25 2:53 PM): Because more people are in the area for traveling to Miami to go see Formula One.

- Unknown (4/30/25 2:53 PM): go pick something up.

- Unknown (4/30/25 2:53 PM): Yeah, and then the second thing is is if you think about employees like associates, I don't know why I'm calling employees, associates in Miami, like if a event like this pops up and you're somebody who's making a little bit above minimum wage or maybe let's say a lot above minimum wage.

- Unknown (4/30/25 2:54 PM): Well, you're either going to take the time off or you're going to probably work one of those events and they're not going to have a lot of employees there. So like in in uh

- Unknown (4/30/25 2:54 PM): Yeah, that makes sense.

- Unknown (4/30/25 2:54 PM): Yeah, so like in Shawny Kansas when I had I I had to plan for like special events like when people came down there because you would you would see your workforce which is normally there not be there and you would just have to get head count goes down.

- Unknown (4/30/25 2:54 PM): And nothing you could offer because the amount of money they can make in those few days is way above what they'll make. They'll probably make all their money during those those few days.

- Unknown (4/30/25 2:54 PM): selling water or whatever. There's going to be a lot of opportunity for people.

- Unknown (4/30/25 2:54 PM): I think we'll never see that.

- Unknown (4/30/25 2:54 PM): Yeah. And probably also, if you think about the restaurant business down there, I I go take off and go work at a restaurant where it's a gratuity. Yeah, cuz it's not tips. It's a gratuity in Miami.

- Unknown (4/30/25 2:55 PM): Oh, nice.

- Unknown (4/30/25 2:55 PM): Yeah. I mean, not for when you're visiting, but but it's nice it's nice for them because the restaurants are going to be packed. It doesn't matter how well you do. You're going to make probably $6, $700, $800 in tips that night.

- Unknown (4/30/25 2:55 PM): So yeah, I might want to go down there and work. I think I need to take some time off for Formula One, Josh.

- Unknown (4/30/25 2:55 PM): Formula One. I'm going to go to Miami.

- Unknown (4/30/25 2:55 PM): Go work as a server.

- Unknown (4/30/25 2:55 PM): I thought about it back in Dallas. I was like going to a upscale restaurant.

- Unknown (4/30/25 2:55 PM): I need a quick approval from you on a.

- Unknown (4/30/25 2:55 PM): I saw that. What is it?

- Unknown (4/30/25 2:55 PM): Uh it's for uh JW logistics funds.

- Unknown (4/30/25 2:55 PM): from here. It should be the.

- Unknown (4/30/25 2:55 PM): You didn't know we put a pause on all payments to vendors.

- Unknown (4/30/25 2:56 PM): $40,000 into Sidarth's Chase bank account.

- Unknown (4/30/25 2:56 PM): Okay.

- Unknown (4/30/25 2:56 PM): All right, it's approved.

- Unknown (4/30/25 2:56 PM): Was that uh sitting next to me?

- Unknown (4/30/25 2:56 PM): She look like her.

- Unknown (4/30/25 2:56 PM): I don't think so.

- Unknown (4/30/25 2:56 PM): Because I thought that she looked like her, but then Rebecca also pointed to Sarah when she was talking like she said Sarah, you would be tracking.

- Unknown (4/30/25 2:56 PM): I think it's a different Sarah.

- Unknown (4/30/25 2:56 PM): I don't think it's that Sarah. I know what Sarah looks like.

- Unknown (4/30/25 2:56 PM): Yeah, yeah.

- Unknown (4/30/25 2:56 PM): But oh, you

- Unknown (4/30/25 2:56 PM): Am I? You never know. It could be her kid.

- Unknown (4/30/25 2:56 PM): I don't know if I don't know if she got kids at all, but

- Unknown (4/30/25 2:57 PM): I feel like you could have walked over to Chris Knight and he would have gave you anything you wanted.

- Unknown (4/30/25 2:57 PM): Yo.

- Unknown (4/30/25 2:57 PM): Sorry, yo.

- Unknown (4/30/25 2:57 PM): Like I'm from Texas. I don't say yo like that.

- Unknown (4/30/25 2:57 PM): Is he from Texas?

- Unknown (4/30/25 2:57 PM): No.

- Unknown (4/30/25 2:57 PM): I think he he may be from like real Arkansas.

- Unknown (4/30/25 2:57 PM): It's been meeting though.

- Unknown (4/30/25 2:57 PM): Yeah, it was. learn a lot about

- Unknown (4/30/25 2:57 PM): Well, I'm surprised that Spark Shopper left now.

- Unknown (4/30/25 2:57 PM): Yeah.

- Unknown (4/30/25 2:57 PM): So basically the four things that they have divided, it was all falling under Natha's process, right?

- Unknown (4/30/25 2:57 PM): Yeah, everything was falling under.

- Unknown (4/30/25 2:57 PM): thing was under him. it's like four.

- Unknown (4/30/25 2:57 PM): Yeah.

- Unknown (4/30/25 2:57 PM): Yeah.

- Unknown (4/30/25 2:57 PM): Spark Shopper is like a go store.

- Unknown (4/30/25 2:57 PM): Spark Shopper is basically uh picking and deliver. So basically the drivers because they don't have back room space. They just park their van with their car and go pick up the Insta cart basically.

- Unknown (4/30/25 2:57 PM): Yeah, which is for our stores and for Walmart local, I guess.

- Unknown (4/30/25 2:58 PM): to do so I'll be able to.

- Unknown (4/30/25 2:58 PM): You'll be able to go on your.

- Unknown (4/30/25 2:58 PM): He said he said finally by by the way, by the way, I have PTO scheduled.

- Unknown (4/30/25 2:58 PM): All right, it wouldn't be you'd have to take everybody. I'm sorry. If I try to go to Miami by myself, I'll die.

- Unknown (4/30/25 2:58 PM): LeBron James playing his last game today?

- Unknown (4/30/25 2:58 PM): Yes, 100%.

- Unknown (4/30/25 2:58 PM): I think two years back when they lost to Denver, he said he said that he needs to evaluate a lot of.

- Unknown (4/30/25 2:58 PM): Oh, you mean his last game like no, he's not playing his last game.

- Unknown (4/30/25 2:58 PM): You never know.

- Unknown (4/30/25 2:58 PM): No, he's not. Not with Luka.

- Unknown (4/30/25 2:58 PM): He's not going to win.

- Unknown (4/30/25 2:58 PM): He's he's still playing some quality quality minutes for somebody with 40-year-old knees.

- Unknown (4/30/25 2:58 PM): Like what is the point of playing and not winning?

- Unknown (4/30/25 2:59 PM): He made it to the playoffs.

- Unknown (4/30/25 2:59 PM): He he just picked the worst team to play.

- Unknown (4/30/25 2:59 PM): What about somehow Rob Pelinka finding a way to get Janis to Lakers?

- Unknown (4/30/25 2:59 PM): That's not happening.

- Unknown (4/30/25 2:59 PM): You don't have to.

- Unknown (4/30/25 2:59 PM): You don't you don't need Janis though. That wouldn't work.

- Unknown (4/30/25 2:59 PM): I mean, you do need a center though.

- Unknown (4/30/25 2:59 PM): No, you need a center, but you don't need a Janis.

- Unknown (4/30/25 2:59 PM): I mean, you you got to divide you got to divide uh the court by three people who need the ball just to go straight to the rim.

- Unknown (4/30/25 2:59 PM): Janis will not need the ball if there is someone else who's willing to take the ball.

- Unknown (4/30/25 2:59 PM): I mean, he takes the ball and he just runs and runs inside and just overpowers everybody.

- Unknown (4/30/25 2:59 PM): So, I mean, you'd have two people cuz that's essentially what LeBron used to do, but he can't do anymore cuz he's old. But

- Unknown (4/30/25 2:59 PM): He's going to get them a lot of rim protection.

- Unknown (4/30/25 2:59 PM): Yeah. He I think they don't have. I think you need like a

- Unknown (4/30/25 3:00 PM): Rudy Gobert?

- Unknown (4/30/25 3:00 PM): Hell no.

- Unknown (4/30/25 3:00 PM): Like a Porzinski. Is it Porzinski?

- Unknown (4/30/25 3:00 PM): Who's that tall?

- Unknown (4/30/25 3:00 PM): Porzinga. Yeah, that tall center who can shoot. Um somebody like that who actually can go in. Even um they're not going to be able to get him anymore cuz he plays so good. Um the guy on who's playing the the the Warriors or the Houston Rockets. Uh

- Unknown (4/30/25 3:00 PM): Alibush?

- Unknown (4/30/25 3:00 PM): Yeah.

- Unknown (4/30/25 3:00 PM): Sing Sing.

- Unknown (4/30/25 3:00 PM): Yeah, Singo. Yeah.

- Unknown (4/30/25 3:00 PM): That would be a good person. They need somebody like that.

- Unknown (4/30/25 3:00 PM): They're going to get somebody though.

- Unknown (4/30/25 3:00 PM): get me a slate truck. Have you seen those?

- Unknown (4/30/25 3:00 PM): You seen them? The oh that black pickup truck thingy.

- Unknown (4/30/25 3:00 PM): It's like dark gray, but it looks like an old school truck.

- Unknown (4/30/25 3:00 PM): Yeah. With the electricity.

- Unknown (4/30/25 3:00 PM): no roll windows. It's all just man. Listen to an hour podcast on that right now.

- Unknown (4/30/25 3:00 PM): The slate truck? Yeah, yeah, I saw a bunch of videos of the truck.

- Unknown (4/30/25 3:01 PM): Have you met the who's transitioning in George?

- Unknown (4/30/25 3:01 PM): I met like two. Which one did you meet because I'm meeting one.

- Unknown (4/30/25 3:01 PM): What's her name?

- Unknown (4/30/25 3:01 PM): Uh the Tajaswi of uh of the team. I don't know her name.

- Unknown (4/30/25 3:01 PM): just Tajaswi kind of report.

- Unknown (4/30/25 3:01 PM): Yeah.

- Unknown (4/30/25 3:01 PM): Helen?

- Unknown (4/30/25 3:01 PM): Helen.

- Unknown (4/30/25 3:01 PM): Helen. Yeah. I had it H in my mind. I had H in my mind, but I couldn't see her badge.

- Unknown (4/30/25 3:01 PM): Oh yeah, I I'd make up a name.

- Unknown (4/30/25 3:01 PM): Like I would make up a name. I do it all the time. Like and they're like, no, that's not a person.

- Unknown (4/30/25 3:01 PM): Okay, and then it was and then she and then uh I met someone else on a Zoom meeting, but it was like group call. It wasn't like, hey, what's up?

- Unknown (4/30/25 3:01 PM): Okay.

- Unknown (4/30/25 3:01 PM): Oh, Mike was Mike up or something there?

- Unknown (4/30/25 3:01 PM): I don't think he was.

- Unknown (4/30/25 3:01 PM): I don't know what he looks like.

- Unknown (4/30/25 3:01 PM): He's here, but I I know what he looks like, but I'm meeting with Helen tomorrow. I don't know what she looks like.

- Unknown (4/30/25 3:01 PM): She was oh, you didn't see her when she came down here.

- Unknown (4/30/25 3:02 PM): I was presenting.

- Unknown (4/30/25 3:02 PM): global health fitness for gym.

- Unknown (4/30/25 3:02 PM): Oh, okay.

- Unknown (4/30/25 3:02 PM): They had like a public relations constituency.

- Unknown (4/30/25 3:02 PM): So this stage uh this stage did to where the chef didn't have an item and they didn't Walmart saved the day with the delivery.

- Unknown (4/30/25 3:02 PM): Oh, that's nice.

- Unknown (4/30/25 3:02 PM): I saved the day with the delivery something inside in the home.

- Unknown (4/30/25 3:02 PM): In the house. So we don't we don't define a home. It could be a jail. It could be a business. We do whatever.

- Unknown (4/30/25 3:02 PM): Do whatever.

- Unknown (4/30/25 3:02 PM): Warren was out camping like I think it was like two months ago, he shot me a text and he was in Oklahoma somewhere camping. He saw the in home van come and deliver to the tent.

- Unknown (4/30/25 3:02 PM): No way.

- Unknown (4/30/25 3:02 PM): I'm like, dude, that's that's kind of feels like so like like I'm like that's not the way I'm going to take short camping, like.

- Unknown (4/30/25 3:02 PM): That's awesome though.

- Unknown (4/30/25 3:02 PM): You can you can get your delivery right to the tent.

- Unknown (4/30/25 3:02 PM): Your makeshift home.

- Unknown (4/30/25 3:03 PM): Here we go.

- Unknown (4/30/25 3:03 PM): Yeah, yeah. even did it.

- Unknown (4/30/25 3:03 PM): Hey, it'd be a really big business in California.

- Unknown (4/30/25 3:03 PM): I mean, I went to the dropping the pin thing. I mean.

- Unknown (4/30/25 3:03 PM): Oh, cuz y'all have uh the pin drop.

- Unknown (4/30/25 3:03 PM): Yeah, I mean I think I think I mean if I think about Warren and his camping, I'm sure he's like right next to the road, you know what I mean?

- Unknown (4/30/25 3:03 PM): It's not a hard.

- Unknown (4/30/25 3:03 PM): And if his neighbor is like ordering in home delivery too, I'm sure it's like.

- Unknown (4/30/25 3:03 PM): I mean, yeah.

- Unknown (4/30/25 3:03 PM): typical campsite. It can't be.

- Unknown (4/30/25 3:03 PM): Cuz you cuz you've you've paid for uh yeah.

- Unknown (4/30/25 3:03 PM): It's probably like the tent is already all built and it's more like what's it called like glamping, I think. It's probably like something more like.

- Unknown (4/30/25 3:03 PM): Extreme campsite.

- Unknown (4/30/25 3:03 PM): All right, cool. Did you uh did you get any insights around the data part from her when y'all met with her? That was basically what I was going to ask.

- Unknown (4/30/25 3:03 PM): She just doesn't seem like Asian has the same problems with us and they have the data tables issues that we have where it's managed by some other team but we rely on it to pay their bills so sounds like she's pretty similar to our business.

- Unknown (4/30/25 3:04 PM): Same invoice problems.

- Unknown (4/30/25 3:04 PM): Does she does she do business insights like or just data? She just started.

- Unknown (4/30/25 3:04 PM): Yeah, last month. She's not going to have no information for you. Yeah.

- Unknown (4/30/25 3:04 PM): Has she has she been at Walmart before?

- Unknown (4/30/25 3:04 PM): I don't.

- Unknown (4/30/25 3:04 PM): She looks young but she just started working.

- Unknown (4/30/25 3:04 PM): Yeah.

- Unknown (4/30/25 3:04 PM): Okay. Okay, perfect. All right. I can work with it. Fresh out of college.

- Unknown (4/30/25 3:04 PM): I mean, when you need help, you can't when you're begging for help, you take what you know. I think I think as someone that's fresh, we have the capabilities and then be able to build appropriate habits and build build the experience right.

- Unknown (4/30/25 3:04 PM): Just set up meetings for us to touch base with them.

- Unknown (4/30/25 3:04 PM): How are balloons at?

- Unknown (4/30/25 3:04 PM): I told Alan he's good to go.

- Unknown (4/30/25 3:04 PM): Yeah, they're they're working on it.

- Unknown (4/30/25 3:04 PM): Okay, good.

- Unknown (4/30/25 3:04 PM): Yeah.

- Unknown (4/30/25 3:05 PM): They got it.

- Unknown (4/30/25 3:05 PM): They got it.

- Unknown (4/30/25 3:05 PM): They got it.

- Unknown (4/30/25 3:05 PM): I was in a slack group and they got it all figured out.

- Unknown (4/30/25 3:05 PM): If you have any issues, let me know, let's call me so.

- Unknown (4/30/25 3:05 PM): Okay, cool.

- Unknown (4/30/25 3:05 PM): Well, looks like.

- Unknown (4/30/25 3:05 PM): Now, rough isn't good there.

- Unknown (4/30/25 3:05 PM): I was imagining it.

- Unknown (4/30/25 3:05 PM): Look at the Did you see the presentation?

- Unknown (4/30/25 3:05 PM): Yeah.

- Unknown (4/30/25 3:05 PM): Seem kind of normal to me. A lot of like AB testing basics of technology and including an app that should have been done years ago.

- Unknown (4/30/25 3:05 PM): He's been pushing for that too.

- Unknown (4/30/25 3:05 PM): All right, I think I don't think he like wants it for a title. I think he wants it more for the freedom to be able to move faster for all the approvals he has to go through right now to get something done.

- Unknown (4/30/25 3:05 PM): He's been pushing that slide deck cuz that was that was my fourth time seeing that slide deck. I'm like and it gets it gets it's different every time. It's better every time.

- Unknown (4/30/25 3:06 PM): I was telling Josh from my team.

- Unknown (4/30/25 3:06 PM): my whole training, my whole training that based off what I saw today.

- Unknown (4/30/25 3:06 PM): No, it was it was good.

- Unknown (4/30/25 3:06 PM): Again, the best investment training safety awareness.

- Unknown (4/30/25 3:06 PM): Yeah.

- Unknown (4/30/25 3:06 PM): The private fleet is actually doubling so they're going to have 100 something like facilitators.

- Unknown (4/30/25 3:06 PM): Really?

- Unknown (4/30/25 3:06 PM): Are you going to that thing tomorrow?

- Unknown (4/30/25 3:06 PM): The driver uh obstacle course still.

- Unknown (4/30/25 3:06 PM): Oh, is it the rodeo?

- Unknown (4/30/25 3:06 PM): Yeah, the rodeo.

- Unknown (4/30/25 3:06 PM): Kelly's going from my team. I think there's like.

- Unknown (4/30/25 3:06 PM): Hey, come over and do like between my downtime.

- Unknown (4/30/25 3:06 PM): Like I actually am like I don't I keep I keep it fixed.

- Unknown (4/30/25 3:06 PM): Hey, I'll just ask.

- Unknown (4/30/25 3:06 PM): Hey, like you can work from the rodeo.

- Unknown (4/30/25 3:06 PM): Have to work from there.

- Unknown (4/30/25 3:07 PM): Yeah, no, we have to work from there.

- Unknown (4/30/25 3:07 PM): I was telling Kelly cuz she's going to be responsible for like helping out build out like our course. But it's it's interesting like, you know, the investment that the private fleet does and then our uh there's like Amazon. So they're they have a three-day program. I said I don't know if you read about it yet Josh or not. But like it's like it's for DSPs.

- Unknown (4/30/25 3:07 PM): So they they train not only DSPs, they train the drivers. They train the drivers too. The the physical drivers like they have to go through a training program.

- Unknown (4/30/25 3:07 PM): We should probably build one for our associates.

- Unknown (4/30/25 3:07 PM): Yeah, no, definitely. That makes sense.

- Unknown (4/30/25 3:07 PM): So then be able to use for like.

- Unknown (4/30/25 3:07 PM): No, well we we don't want to do it for the DSPs cuz that's a big that's like that's one of the big like troubling issues for them is that are they employees? I mean, yeah, they're not they're expanding their they have no uh their lawyers are very unrisk averse.

- Unknown (4/30/25 3:07 PM): Their lawyers are mostly like we'll pay it comes to it versus ours are we're going to figure another way.

- Unknown (4/30/25 3:08 PM): We we we don't want to we don't want to go to court.

- Unknown (4/30/25 3:08 PM): Don't tell anybody that cuz I'm putting that as part of my business.

- Unknown (4/30/25 3:08 PM): No, no, you no, you should. No, you should 100%.

- Unknown (4/30/25 3:08 PM): In order to get to that, we should probably get our all the people like taking.

- Unknown (4/30/25 3:08 PM): Yeah, I mean if they do that, you should definitely do that. And FedEx and UPS do it too.

- Unknown (4/30/25 3:08 PM): Yeah, yeah. That's the best part that's all in my in my kids.

- Unknown (4/30/25 3:08 PM): And and they have internal well UPS doesn't anymore, but FedEx definitely has internal um drivers. So that's cool. All right.

- Unknown (4/30/25 3:08 PM): Cool.

- Unknown (4/30/25 3:08 PM): Did you take a or you take a to the trip? I got the actual deck from Mario and I'm going to send it to our group.

- Unknown (4/30/25 3:08 PM): He sent it to me too?

- Unknown (4/30/25 3:08 PM): Well, yeah, I'm sending it to our group.

- Unknown (4/30/25 3:08 PM): Oh, to our group.

- Unknown (4/30/25 3:08 PM): Mario has all the insights, doesn't he?

- Unknown (4/30/25 3:08 PM): Okay.

- Unknown (4/30/25 3:09 PM): It's raining again, isn't it?

- Unknown (4/30/25 3:09 PM): Yep. It's your fault.

- Unknown (4/30/25 3:09 PM): What did I do?

- Unknown (4/30/25 3:09 PM): You made it rain.

- Unknown (4/30/25 3:09 PM): When is your birthday?

- Unknown (4/30/25 3:09 PM): What? When's your birthday?

- Unknown (4/30/25 3:09 PM): December. When is my what? Birthday.

- Unknown (4/30/25 3:09 PM): December 37th. I know exactly when you're going.

- Unknown (4/30/25 3:09 PM): What is James? Oh my goodness. Josh. Josh is a big Bronny James fan.

- Unknown (4/30/25 3:09 PM): Who who wouldn't be a Bronny James fan?

- Unknown (4/30/25 3:09 PM): He's waiting for him to get to top to the gym.

- Unknown (4/30/25 3:10 PM): Waiting for them to get together and win a championship.

- Unknown (4/30/25 3:10 PM): I'm not joking. I'm not seeing together in December.

- Unknown (4/30/25 3:10 PM): I'll be right back. Are we are we meeting in a room or uh no, let's just take it at our desk.

- Unknown (4/30/25 3:10 PM): Okay.

- Unknown (4/30/25 3:10 PM): Hey, what's up?

- Unknown (4/30/25 3:10 PM): Hello, can you hear me?

- Unknown (4/30/25 3:10 PM): What's up? How you doing?

- Unknown (4/30/25 3:10 PM): Good, good. Just work.

- Unknown (4/30/25 3:10 PM): Huh, go for it.

- Unknown (4/30/25 3:11 PM): I would say from a tax liability standpoint, I would do a stock because if you do a um if you do a business, you're going to have to pay taxes on that money next year or this year. Cuz you you're not supposed to use uh your retirement money until you uh retire. Yeah. But if you do it if you do a stock, yeah, if you do a stock, um so if you put it in uh you got to research which which uh 401k you could do it in. I not 401k, but which uh like which avenue you do it in, but if you if you do it in like uh one of those avenues that is like uh I don't know what it's called. But if you do it in one of those avenues where it's uh it it's a stock, you won't um you won't face any tax liability issues.

- Unknown (4/30/25 3:12 PM): I would say like right now, you would do S&P just because everything is relatively down because of, you know, your your best friend, your boy.

- Unknown (4/30/25 3:12 PM): So you can't you can't really Yeah.

- Unknown (4/30/25 3:12 PM): I mean, yeah, I so I would I would say I I would either do a few big companies that you know is not not not going to be bad, it's just because of tariffs and stuff.

- Unknown (4/30/25 3:12 PM): Or I would just do the S&P um because you'll see you'll see a huge return by the end by the end of the either the term or when he starts acting right.

- Unknown (4/30/25 3:13 PM): Yeah, no, I would I would keep it that way because if you use the fucking office, you're going to have to pay like seven or you're going to have to pay a whole bunch of a whole bunch of money. It's like a big um it's a big it's a big one. It's one that probably, you know, just because of how much money it is, you'll probably end up uh either on a payment plan or they trying to come get you.

- Unknown (4/30/25 3:13 PM): So I would I would I would stay away from it and put it in the fund because they got funds um it's like I I have to look it up and I I'll text it to you, but they got funds where you don't have to um pay tax on it. Um and you can still invest it however you want.

- Unknown (4/30/25 3:14 PM): next few days. Just just call me, call me anytime after like 7:00, I'm at home.

- Unknown (4/30/25 3:14 PM): All right, man. Look.

- Unknown (4/30/25 3:14 PM): Get out, watch yourself.

- Unknown (4/30/25 3:14 PM): Right.

- Unknown (4/30/25 3:14 PM): Okay, so I'll send them the email.

- Unknown (4/30/25 3:15 PM): Please.

- Unknown (4/30/25 3:21 PM): Nope, I got it. So just explaining how router works with Spark.

- Unknown (4/30/25 3:21 PM): Exactly. And then once we have explained how routing works with Spark, that's where we will then pivot to the contractual language. Uh and you got any feedback on this test?

- Unknown (4/30/25 3:22 PM): Yeah, just to uh provide some background about here what happened.

- Unknown (4/30/25 3:22 PM): So basically what I'm like corporate operations are suggesting is that there is as I said a high cost involved with doing quite a bit of size like Nash, which is why we didn't think that on Nash or not getting trying to get it in Nash.

- Unknown (4/30/25 3:22 PM): What if we draft a contract with Nash to get this cost is the most cost involved with vendors and that option is provided to the vendors, they can use either Nash or

- Unknown (4/30/25 3:22 PM): or how they're routing and instead it's basically whichever they want to do.

- Unknown (4/30/25 3:22 PM): But given this cost is so exorbitantly high for Nash, they would want to uh have an agreement and that is providing optionality.

- Unknown (4/30/25 3:22 PM): And if they like if they're not choosing Nash, it's up to them, that's their decision.

- Unknown (4/30/25 3:22 PM): We're just providing that optionality in my eyes.

- Unknown (4/30/25 3:23 PM): Um, so as

- Unknown (4/30/25 3:23 PM): Yep.

- Unknown (4/30/25 3:23 PM): And then my portion again, red, yellow, green requirements are just getting as for details here, what the risk looks like from a made by state perspective.

- Unknown (4/30/25 3:23 PM): Um and then helping massage solutions for us against and hopefully I can say frankly, I think it's a lot of what we already shared on our SW earlier, probably just a little bit.

- Unknown (4/30/25 3:23 PM): whatever.

- Unknown (4/30/25 3:23 PM): And then Ashrum, do you understand this or do you have any questions?

- Unknown (4/30/25 3:23 PM): Yep, so it would be FedEx and then it would be uh ESP model routes.

- Unknown (4/30/25 3:24 PM): subcontractor.

- Unknown (4/30/25 3:24 PM): And then lawsuits.

- Unknown (4/30/25 3:24 PM): And then we just create like another section that has the risk.

- Unknown (4/30/25 3:24 PM): So this would be high risk.

- Unknown (4/30/25 3:24 PM): Amazon would be high risk and then hours would be medium risk but we're going through.

- Unknown (4/30/25 3:24 PM): around hours not actually ESP.

- Unknown (4/30/25 3:24 PM): Makes sense?

- Unknown (4/30/25 3:24 PM): Cool.

- Unknown (4/30/25 3:24 PM): And if we can have this all done by Friday, I want to send this to check over so he can meet him in person if we can so that way next week when comes back, we can share hopefully good news that we've managed to work with legal and bought into the new contractual language around routing and target to allow IP to spend on that as well.

- Unknown (4/30/25 3:25 PM): I think I shared this in the meeting as well, but although we are told that we can launch 200 vendors, you guys are starting to see IP is figuring out other ways to move their volume around the apartments and they're not going to wait on us and then I would see wait on us, so I want to push on the gas and figure out a solution on how we can support everything that IP wants to do.

- Unknown (4/30/25 3:25 PM): A large part of this business obviously. um I think about 12 stores when they come to human to buy and of those 12 stores because of legal, we can only support in 56% of that in that area.

- Unknown (4/30/25 3:25 PM): So we're to market soft areas where we're already in, but this ability for us to scale was going to continue to slow down because most of the markets that we need to scale are in California.

- Unknown (4/30/25 3:26 PM): That's where the push for this is coming from, so I just want our program to have as minimal risk as possible in terms of our ability to support and scale and if this idea doesn't work, it doesn't work but at least we can try something to help get this app reprioritized and get ourselves into risky markets faster without the app.

- Unknown (4/30/25 3:26 PM): Do you do you want how routing will work with Nash too or do you want me to just keep it on Spark?

- Unknown (4/30/25 3:26 PM): I would do all three because for Nash to address the language, it's going to need to understand how the routing works.

- Unknown (4/30/25 3:26 PM): So I would support for Nash, Spark and FedEx and the driver routing would just be they have to really be a skip route.

- Unknown (4/30/25 3:27 PM): If we were able to enable that, how how that would work.

- Unknown (4/30/25 3:27 PM): Okay, so in the current system, how that would work.

- Unknown (4/30/25 3:27 PM): So I can just I can bucket that with Spark.

- Unknown (4/30/25 3:27 PM): And then for Nash, do you want how it how it currently works or do you want how it will work if we were able to get get it done with no tech work.

- Unknown (4/30/25 3:27 PM): How we would get it done with no tech work.

- Unknown (4/30/25 3:27 PM): Okay.

- Unknown (4/30/25 3:27 PM): Because we need to figure out a way to convince legal that Nash does not create routes period.

- Unknown (4/30/25 3:27 PM): No, Nash does create routes, but it's at the behest of not Walmart.

- Unknown (4/30/25 3:27 PM): Okay, so then maybe we'll just do both, right? We'll just say how Nash is versus what it could be.

- Unknown (4/30/25 3:28 PM): Yeah, okay, so I'll have yeah.

- Unknown (4/30/25 3:28 PM): It yeah, I got you.

- Unknown (4/30/25 3:28 PM): And keep it all pretty simple and you know, short format.

- Unknown (4/30/25 3:28 PM): The intention is to just create three slides, first slide, how does routing work for all three platforms, contractual language that we can put into the contract that mitigates any risk plus yellow green requirements and then the last slide is going to be Intel so that way he can't say Amazon doesn't have unbranded vans or a unbranded app.

- Unknown (4/30/25 3:28 PM): Uh, I'll get with you actually later and have more in depth conversation on this, but this your specific action is because C Scott does not understand how the Amazon app and structure works and he said he thinks that uh just because you remove the branding from an app that that reduces the ability to be sued.

- Unknown (4/30/25 3:29 PM): We both know that that's not the case and I think you've got some photos of what the app looks like, right?

- Unknown (4/30/25 3:29 PM): Yes, yes.

- Unknown (4/30/25 3:29 PM): So we can share those pictures with and then quick table that just shows you know, again what you're seeing here, lawsuits, quality of lawsuits.

- Unknown (4/30/25 3:29 PM): I know it's fine.

- Unknown (4/30/25 3:29 PM): Ideally, so ideally we get all of this information put in front of C Scott and say, do you have any concerns or any more questions because we have now responded to the Walmart branded app concern and the concern around parent routing, which is Walmart routing.

- Unknown (4/30/25 3:30 PM): The intention is to just have zero questions from him and uh at that point we can uh push it up to and to get it in front of Sarah, explain our side as well.

- Unknown (4/30/25 3:30 PM): But the priority should be to influence C Scott because he's the guy that is basically summarizing all of this to Sarah and providing his input to Sarah.

- Unknown (4/30/25 3:30 PM): Um I don't think it's necessarily coming down from her unless she's heard otherwise.

- Unknown (4/30/25 3:31 PM): Now we'll tell Mark today that we want that we can support in everywhere but Massachusetts and New Jersey and then we'll have the final response for Massachusetts and Jersey by next week.

- Unknown (4/30/25 3:31 PM): So that gives us at least eight new launches.

- Unknown (4/30/25 3:31 PM): So with that said, start off at the top, uh, Mario.

- Unknown (4/30/25 3:32 PM): So you know it's raining. They had a lot of rain. That is a tornado coming our way. So enjoy all the Phoenix Sun.

- Unknown (4/30/25 3:32 PM): Just wait. It'll get a little darker when we get here.

- Unknown (4/30/25 3:32 PM): Uh, still got nothing major, but uh, tomorrow I meet your house and do each of the four CBD table updates and stuff that should be there. that's all these. So we need to leave it. Um, if we need any corrections to be made, thanks for that. We can keep that close. Do that right now.

- Unknown (4/30/25 3:32 PM): Yep, I'll be on that meeting.

- Unknown (4/30/25 3:32 PM): Uh, has Michael shared the address location with you guys for the driver Costco horse thing?

- Unknown (4/30/25 3:32 PM): Oh.

- Unknown (4/30/25 3:32 PM): Oswald.

- Unknown (4/30/25 3:33 PM): And uh, Hakeem.

- Unknown (4/30/25 3:33 PM): Oh, nothing for me. Um, yeah, nothing for me.

- Unknown (4/30/25 3:33 PM): Are for for this, is there like uh, you want us to make slides or are we going to make um, words and then turn it into slides or is there a format?

- Unknown (4/30/25 3:33 PM): No, just dump all the information to me and then I'll create the slide source.

- Unknown (4/30/25 3:33 PM): Oh, perfect. I love that.

- Unknown (4/30/25 3:34 PM): So so no, so um, long story short, I had we had a debate and conversation with Ramia. Um, there may be no resources needed to use Nash. And I say maybe because uh, about three weeks ago she told me that there would need to be tech work done and now there may not need to be tech work done. It's just configs, changes for to utilize Nash.

- Unknown (4/30/25 3:34 PM): Um, with that being said, obviously there's the cost feature um of 70 cents per package and then the complications of having to utilize onboard with us and then onboard with Nash. So that's a whole deal. But um, in all honesty for me, I for me like from just a product perspective, I'm okay with utilizing Nash because it gives me a business case um to build it out because of the expensive cost. But um, due to the conversation with um, with Scott and his concerns, um, we may be able to bypass that. So that's kind of why it it came up of maybe we show um, show that we give the option and maybe that helps out. But with that being said, there would be no additional resources because pretty much it's like Uber or point pickup. You we build a route. We I mean we don't build a route. We group a selection of packages, we hand it over to the DSPs and then uh Nash would do the routing um and that would be it. Uh, the bad part is is there would be a horrible custom, I mean, uh associate experience because obviously when we do this with big and bulky, it's only like, you know, probably like 30 orders, right? Um up to 100, I'm guessing during AE. But um, it's obviously not routed. So we're just handing over packages and then they're they're bringing, you know, whatever they have to come and pick them up.

- Unknown (4/30/25 3:36 PM): I couldn't tell you at this juncture because I don't I don't know enough about Nash to tell you how it would be different because I've never done it like operationally. Um, so I I have no idea.

- Unknown (4/30/25 3:36 PM): No, that's Mike Mike Roberts probably the only person who will talk to you at this point. It it used to be Michael's team. But um, but I think Mike Roberts would be the only person and then I think probably Mike Mike DiFiori would have the most information on how operationally it is good or it sucks.

- Unknown (4/30/25 3:37 PM): All right, short and sweet meeting. But uh, actually, Oswald, you're out this week, right? So I can take on the uh Intel stuff.

- Unknown (4/30/25 3:37 PM): Okay. Cool. All right, if anyone has any concerns, call outs, just let me know. But uh, I think next week we'll have a lot more direction on how our org team is going to look. So for now, all we can try to do is hold in our ability to grow and launch our bands and not just be at at the mercy of people in front of us. So more to come. I hope you guys have a good day and I'll talk to you.

- Unknown (4/30/25 3:38 PM): Would Ronnie James sit on the sidelines and wait or would he go in and make the game winner?

- Unknown (4/30/25 3:38 PM): I'm sure I'm sure he wants to go in.

- Unknown (4/30/25 3:38 PM): We're basically Ronnie James. We want to go in. The coach won't let us.

- Unknown (4/30/25 3:38 PM): Nobody's letting us letting us go in.

- Unknown (4/30/25 3:38 PM): No, I think I think I think it's even worse. I think we're Westbrook.

- Unknown (4/30/25 3:38 PM): Westbrook.

- Unknown (4/30/25 3:38 PM): Yeah, because we had Well, yeah, we we we've had some really really good games. We were up to 600 and then someone was like, I'm going to put you on the bench. You got to come in later. And now we now we're left with eight bands. Oh, shoot, man.

- Unknown (4/30/25 3:39 PM): Clarity or Oh, that's okay. That keeps that keeps us average 20% growth rate continuity.

- Unknown (4/30/25 3:39 PM): We are 20 rate is like 20%.

- Unknown (4/30/25 3:39 PM): It's just one eight bands at a time. You know.

- Unknown (4/30/25 3:39 PM): Eight bands per month.

- Unknown (4/30/25 3:39 PM): You got You just you just got to you got to go that route. Well, it's crazy that we are What are they doing? They're doing uh multi staging. Multi staging. So it just means the packages sit there later. So they're able to stage in the morning and then they stay then they're going to stage at night. And they also want to do same day delivery. Well, yes. That's why that's why they want later inject. Yeah, they want to increase customer speed where at the same time they're going to let the packages sit. I don't know who came up with the multi staging idea. But do they have the space to do the multi staging? Apparently they do. I have no idea who came up with the multi staging idea. It wasn't me. Van was the solution for store capacity. Yeah, Van was the solution for store capacity and then John DB asked if there was another way to do it. And then Cara got me on the call and then we figured out another way to do it. Which is multi staging. Yeah. So the trailer comes at the same time. Yep, trailer comes the same time. And then on do all these packages. Yeah, so they're able to they're able to stage how however many the first packages and then I'm guessing the rest goes into for no to pull and they're able to stage later. Smart catchment is less than uh IT catchment, right?

- Unknown (4/30/25 3:40 PM): No.

- Unknown (4/30/25 3:40 PM): It's the same.

- Unknown (4/30/25 3:40 PM): It's the same.

- Unknown (4/30/25 3:40 PM): So all catchment is is within 15 miles of I mean all catchment is DFS catchment.

- Unknown (4/30/25 3:40 PM): Interesting.

- Unknown (4/30/25 3:40 PM): The only person whose catchment is different is in home.

- Unknown (4/30/25 3:40 PM): Interesting.

- Unknown (4/30/25 3:41 PM): Smart drivers would be loaded in. How's the matching happening for multi staging? Is it like

- Unknown (4/30/25 3:41 PM): So the on the basis of scans for Yeah, so whatever whatever No, it's going to be terrible.

- Unknown (4/30/25 3:41 PM): Oh wow. That's going to be wild then. So basically you are our routing is diluted even further.

- Unknown (4/30/25 3:41 PM): Well, so the issue is is that what routing will have done is created um Now, this is this is I don't know what they did on the FC side. So they could have done it to where they created two two batches, one that you um that you stage at eight and then one that you stage at um later, which is probably what they did because that's that's the only way conceptually that I can see it.

- Unknown (4/30/25 3:41 PM): So they create two two batches. That way the first one runs at eight and then the next one they have a trigger that runs at let's say three.

- Unknown (4/30/25 3:42 PM): And then they have to make sure they scan all these packages in the first one by eight and all these packages in the second one by by 12, which is probably what they did.

- Unknown (4/30/25 3:42 PM): So, I mean, it may work.

- Unknown (4/30/25 3:42 PM): But they still have to hold all those packages, the rest of the packages until later.

- Unknown (4/30/25 3:42 PM): multi staging. Or have they already started with it?

- Unknown (4/30/25 3:42 PM): They must have already started with it.

- Unknown (4/30/25 3:42 PM): Interesting.

- Unknown (4/30/25 3:42 PM): Well, multi multi staging works if you have the capability at the FC. I don't know if they have the capability at the FC.

- Unknown (4/30/25 3:42 PM): It'll be interesting because all these things the uh extra large packages coming through.

- Unknown (4/30/25 3:42 PM): Well, that's that's cut off.

- Unknown (4/30/25 3:42 PM): 22 cubic feet is the order size, right?

- Unknown (4/30/25 3:42 PM): But that's the order size of the biggest is big the the biggest average spark um car.

- Unknown (4/30/25 3:42 PM): We got an escalation from deliver all today.

- Unknown (4/30/25 3:42 PM): Uh those are those are DFS packages. I saw it. Yeah.

- Unknown (4/30/25 3:42 PM): two pallets.

- Unknown (4/30/25 3:42 PM): Yeah, those Oh, I saw the carts.

- Unknown (4/30/25 3:43 PM): Yeah, two pallets uh belonging to one order.

- Unknown (4/30/25 3:43 PM): Yeah, that's DFS.

- Unknown (4/30/25 3:43 PM): So if you ever see those those packages wrapped in um yeah.

- Unknown (4/30/25 3:43 PM): not wrapped in. Okay, got it.

- Unknown (4/30/25 3:43 PM): Yeah. So that that I mean, Sparks never going to be able to handle, but that's the long-term vision of being able to split customer orders.

- Unknown (4/30/25 3:43 PM): So.

- Unknown (4/30/25 3:43 PM): Do you know what digital twin usages?

- Unknown (4/30/25 3:43 PM): Digital twin usage?

- Unknown (4/30/25 3:43 PM): Twin Innovation Day this Friday.

- Unknown (4/30/25 3:43 PM): doors open at 7:45, 8:00 to 3:00.

- Unknown (4/30/25 3:43 PM): The event is dedicated to discovering the art of possible using physical AI, digital twin technology, hear from executive leadership, see demonstrations of cutting edge digital twin tech.

- Unknown (4/30/25 3:43 PM): I assume it's like your EV or EV glasses, your AR glass.

- Unknown (4/30/25 3:43 PM): This is Apple Intelligence.

- Unknown (4/30/25 3:44 PM): Cuz what they're going to show off is demonstrations with reality digital twin, Apple Vision Pro and tandem digital twin.

- Unknown (4/30/25 3:44 PM): Oh, shoot.

- Unknown (4/30/25 3:44 PM): I want to go.

- Unknown (4/30/25 3:44 PM): Man, when is it?

- Unknown (4/30/25 3:44 PM): This Friday.

- Unknown (4/30/25 3:44 PM): This Friday?

- Unknown (4/30/25 3:44 PM): Jeez, I'm in.

- Unknown (4/30/25 3:44 PM): Let's look at the calendar.

- Unknown (4/30/25 3:44 PM): I've been in the tandem digital twin is warehouse.

- Unknown (4/30/25 3:44 PM): component, product, system and process are digital twins.

- Unknown (4/30/25 3:44 PM): You want to go?

- Unknown (4/30/25 3:44 PM): Yeah.

- Unknown (4/30/25 3:44 PM): lot of VP and SVP people.

- Unknown (4/30/25 3:44 PM): I've Here's Apple Vision Pro.

- Unknown (4/30/25 3:44 PM): That's why it's not augmented reality, it's better than that.

- Unknown (4/30/25 3:44 PM): Spatial computer, that's what it is.

- Unknown (4/30/25 3:46 PM): Brandon Ballard, Kevin Kolowski, Brian Napp, Aaron Hart.

- Unknown (4/30/25 3:46 PM): I didn't send it to the right guys.

- Unknown (4/30/25 3:46 PM): If it's only two people are allowed to go from this whole world.

- Unknown (4/30/25 3:46 PM): It would it would just be one person.

- Unknown (4/30/25 3:46 PM): Here we go, back on our day trip.

- Unknown (4/30/25 3:46 PM): Vision Pro and digital twin shit.

- Unknown (4/30/25 3:46 PM): Well, to be fair, I'll probably on the Vision Pro more than I'm on on a call vision wise.

- Unknown (4/30/25 3:47 PM): No one ever sees my face.

- Unknown (4/30/25 3:47 PM): Only reason is is because for some reason they locked down locked down Zoom really hard.

- Unknown (4/30/25 3:47 PM): I don't know why. Like every time I try to connect on here, it kicks me out after like three or four hours.

- Unknown (4/30/25 3:47 PM): Who's Zoom owned by?

- Unknown (4/30/25 3:47 PM): Microsoft.

- Unknown (4/30/25 3:47 PM): Which is weird, because they also own Teams. And why are we deprecating Zoom?

- Unknown (4/30/25 3:47 PM): They bought Zoom.

- Unknown (4/30/25 3:47 PM): They bought Zoom.

- Unknown (4/30/25 3:47 PM): during the post COVID.

- Unknown (4/30/25 3:47 PM): when Zoom's valuation went up.

- Unknown (4/30/25 3:47 PM): Yeah.

- Unknown (4/30/25 3:47 PM): I don't understand why they're pushing teams too.

- Unknown (4/30/25 3:47 PM): Why are they having their two businesses compete with one another?

- Unknown (4/30/25 3:47 PM): There might be some internal infighting going on.

- Unknown (4/30/25 3:47 PM): CPD, who's cheaper?

- Unknown (4/30/25 3:47 PM): Who has more features?

- Unknown (4/30/25 3:47 PM): Well, Zoom has the better product.

- Unknown (4/30/25 3:47 PM): I think they like distinct user base as well, right?

- Unknown (4/30/25 3:47 PM): I think they shut one down, they don't know.

- Unknown (4/30/25 3:48 PM): Everybody would go over to Zoom if they shut down Teams.

- Unknown (4/30/25 3:48 PM): I hear they're shutting down Teams. That's what the blind. That's what the blind is saying.

- Unknown (4/30/25 3:48 PM): I'll see the downtime 5:00 p.m. 5:00. I was in Google.

- Unknown (4/30/25 3:48 PM): How's it coming?

- Unknown (4/30/25 3:48 PM): Google Hub sitting at my doors.

- Unknown (4/30/25 3:48 PM): Oh, yeah, that's That's going to be you're going to come home and it's just drowning.

- Unknown (4/30/25 3:48 PM): Walmart returns.

- Unknown (4/30/25 3:48 PM): But when I saw that return on there, I was like, how are you going to monetize returns? And I was like, oh, they're talking about returns the ROI.

- Unknown (4/30/25 3:48 PM): You don't have any reverse logistics, right?

- Unknown (4/30/25 3:48 PM): No, we we have returns for in home.

- Unknown (4/30/25 3:48 PM): I I think the the issue with Spark is a legal issue because um because you can't you'd have to have like a trip for just returns and then you're not making any money.

- Unknown (4/30/25 3:48 PM): If you try to make them do a return after afterwards, I think it's uh it'd be it's forcing them to to do I don't know. It's I don't understand legal's logic.

- Unknown (4/30/25 3:49 PM): I don't know that we that we have a whole bunch of Harvard grads on our legal team.

- Unknown (4/30/25 3:49 PM): If Walmart starts taking the same days or build the same business, you know, we want you to do it.

- Unknown (4/30/25 3:49 PM): Oh, no. I I just saw an article that said Walmart and Amazon actually keep your packages.

- Unknown (4/30/25 3:49 PM): Yeah.

- Unknown (4/30/25 3:49 PM): Anything less than 10 bucks from Amazon, you can keep it. So they can't place a big order.

- Unknown (4/30/25 3:49 PM): Oh, sorry, you can keep it. We're doing.

- Unknown (4/30/25 3:49 PM): Yeah, I think it probably there's like a limit on how many times you can do it before they.

- Unknown (4/30/25 3:49 PM): Ask me how I know.

- Unknown (4/30/25 3:49 PM): How many times have you done it?

- Unknown (4/30/25 3:49 PM): Cuz everything I buy is under 10 bucks.

- Unknown (4/30/25 3:49 PM): Is there not a limit on uh how many?

- Unknown (4/30/25 3:49 PM): I think it's tied to like the amount that you spend.

- Unknown (4/30/25 3:49 PM): Oh, okay. So it's not like, oh, you've done four, so you can't do it anymore. It's like if you spend like a grand, they'll be like, oh, you can let this one slide.

- Unknown (4/30/25 3:50 PM): I'm trying to figure out the exact.

- Unknown (4/30/25 3:50 PM): This is this is just research.

- Unknown (4/30/25 3:50 PM): This is this is competitive research.

- Unknown (4/30/25 3:50 PM): Another one that Wayfair.

- Unknown (4/30/25 3:50 PM): We're not coming to get that shit.

- Unknown (4/30/25 3:50 PM): I saw that one time.

- Unknown (4/30/25 3:50 PM): They refunded me.

- Unknown (4/30/25 3:50 PM): lost making business.

- Unknown (4/30/25 3:50 PM): It's all tied to stop. All they care about is getting investor cash.

- Unknown (4/30/25 3:50 PM): That's why most most business most businesses now are cash positive.

- Unknown (4/30/25 3:50 PM): they are they're margin are tiny.

- Unknown (4/30/25 3:50 PM): We have tiny margins.

- Unknown (4/30/25 3:50 PM): All right, boys, and we'll see you later.

- Unknown (4/30/25 3:51 PM): I have no more.

- Unknown (4/30/25 3:51 PM): You want to be there at 7:30?

- Unknown (4/30/25 3:51 PM): Oh, we got to be there at 7:30?

- Unknown (4/30/25 3:51 PM): Can you send the address in the chat?

- Unknown (4/30/25 3:51 PM): Yeah. Can you send the address in the chat?

- Unknown (4/30/25 3:51 PM): something like next to airport.

- Unknown (4/30/25 3:51 PM): Oh, really? Oh, I'll be there on time.

- Unknown (4/30/25 3:51 PM): the blue box have airport.

- Unknown (4/30/25 3:51 PM): I I live uh literally two minutes from the airport, so yeah.

- Unknown (4/30/25 3:51 PM): I have to Uber with one car.

- Unknown (4/30/25 3:51 PM): We we have one car.

- Unknown (4/30/25 3:51 PM): Oh, oh.

- Unknown (4/30/25 3:51 PM): Yeah, it's literally. I've already doing getting together for a minute I got scared because I I assumed that that I was sitting next to the.

- Unknown (4/30/25 3:51 PM): I thought that was the Sarah.

- Unknown (4/30/25 3:51 PM): Oh, that's why you brought it up.

- Unknown (4/30/25 3:51 PM): That's Sarah. That's right.

- Unknown (4/30/25 3:52 PM): She's good. I shouldn't be doing this with my single screen.

- Unknown (4/30/25 3:52 PM): Well, to be fair, we lost a lawyer, so we were just trying to replace them.

- Unknown (4/30/25 3:52 PM): I see.

- Unknown (4/30/25 3:52 PM): You got to save some. There's no there's not going to be replaced anymore.

- Unknown (4/30/25 3:52 PM): Is there really a tornado coming?

- Unknown (4/30/25 3:53 PM): What?

- Unknown (4/30/25 3:53 PM): Is there really a tornado coming?

- Unknown (4/30/25 3:53 PM): I haven't seen.

- Unknown (4/30/25 3:53 PM): Oh, no. This is just so that I know if I should go to the gym or not.

- Unknown (4/30/25 3:53 PM): If it's a real tornado coming, I'll I'll I won't take the risk.

- Unknown (4/30/25 3:53 PM): If it's just rain, I'll take the risk.

- Unknown (4/30/25 3:53 PM): No.

- Unknown (4/30/25 3:53 PM): There's no tornado.

- Unknown (4/30/25 3:53 PM): No, no, no warning.

- Unknown (4/30/25 3:53 PM): Yeah, yeah.

- Unknown (4/30/25 3:53 PM): I haven't checked.

- Unknown (4/30/25 3:53 PM): I'm excited with my progress in gym.

- Unknown (4/30/25 3:53 PM): Huh?

- Unknown (4/30/25 3:53 PM): And then and I did like full set with like 12 repetitions which tells me that I can add more weight.

- Unknown (4/30/25 4:33 PM): She said from colleges.

- Unknown (4/30/25 4:33 PM): She said from colleges.

- Unknown (4/30/25 4:33 PM): Oh.

- Unknown (4/30/25 4:33 PM): Oh, so if they kept the fireplace and let's say water is um water got through the top cap or whatever or leaked through.

- Unknown (4/30/25 4:34 PM): Then it would make sense because this is all together, right? That if there's water there, it's probably coming out of one of these seams, and likely, I bet you, that's why ant problem is.

- Unknown (4/30/25 4:34 PM): Likely that may be like what where our ant problem is coming from too.

- Unknown (4/30/25 4:34 PM): But the good thing is all the answers down, but they kept it, right? So they got leaked. So if it's leaking, it's leaking in there and it's coming out of here, it's likely like just a build up of water that just happened, but um yeah, that's that's just like a problem for them. I mean kind of for us too because if it's a lot of water, if it's not like dripping because it seems like it was a gush, so maybe just a gush got through. But if it's a lot of water, it could I don't even know how that much water.

- Unknown (4/30/25 4:35 PM): Oh, you got us a scale?

- Unknown (4/30/25 4:35 PM): I'm trying to be interested.

- Unknown (4/30/25 4:35 PM): I want to make I want to do like a cookie.

- Unknown (4/30/25 4:35 PM): far layout of party.

- Unknown (4/30/25 4:35 PM): right stuff.

- Unknown (4/30/25 4:35 PM): You got to see it.

- Unknown (4/30/25 4:35 PM): Yeah, eventually I guess.

- Unknown (4/30/25 4:35 PM): trying to give me a box.
